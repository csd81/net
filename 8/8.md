# 🔒 08.8. Access Control Lists (ACLs) — Summary & Guide

Access Control Lists (ACLs) are fundamental tools in Cisco networks for controlling traffic, implementing security policies, and reducing threats. They inspect packets and decide whether to **permit or deny** based on a set of defined rules, improving the overall integrity and efficiency of network communication.

---

## 🌟 1. Why Are ACLs Important?

ACLs are not just about blocking traffic—they are part of a layered defense strategy and help tailor traffic flow to organizational policies.

- ✅ **Traffic Filtering**: Controls which packets can pass through routers or interfaces.
- ✅ **Network Security**: Blocks unauthorized access, preventing internal and external threats.
- ✅ **Performance Optimization**: Reduces unnecessary or malicious traffic to boost performance.
- ✅ **Policy Enforcement**: Ensures only approved users, protocols, or applications communicate.
- ✅ **DDoS & IP Spoofing Protection**: Mitigates attacks by filtering out suspicious or malicious sources.

## 🔑 2. Types of ACLs

| **ACL Type**         | **Description**                                                                 | **Example Usage**                                |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Standard ACLs**    | Filters traffic **only by source IP address**.                                   | Block a single host or range of IPs.             |
| **Extended ACLs**    | Filters by **source/destination IP, protocol, and ports**.                       | Deny Telnet, HTTP, or allow only certain apps.   |
| **Named ACLs**       | ACLs identified by a name instead of a number.                                   | Easier to manage and update.                     |
| **Time-Based ACLs**  | Activates ACLs during defined time ranges.                                       | Allow access during work hours only.             |
| **Reflexive ACLs**   | Dynamic ACLs that allow return traffic for **stateful filtering**.               | Secure outbound sessions like SSH/FTP.           |
| **IPv6 ACLs**        | Filters **IPv6 traffic**, similar to IPv4 ACLs but for modern networks.          | Secure IPv6-enabled environments.                |

## 🛠️ 3. Key ACL Commands & Configuration Examples

### ✅ Standard ACL – Block a Specific Host

```cisco
access-list 10 deny 192.168.1.100
access-list 10 permit any

interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip access-group 10 in
```

🔹 **Explanation**: Blocks all traffic from `192.168.1.100` but permits everything else.

---

### ✅ Extended ACL – Block SSH and HTTP

```cisco
access-list 101 deny tcp any any eq 22
access-list 101 deny tcp any any eq 80
access-list 101 permit ip any any

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip access-group 101 in
```

🔹 **Explanation**: Blocks all incoming SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80) traffic.

---

### ✅ IPv6 ACL – Allow Specific IPv6 Subnet

```cisco
ipv6 access-list ALLOW_SUBNET
 permit ipv6 2001:DB8:1::/64 any
 deny ipv6 any any

interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 ipv6 traffic-filter ALLOW_SUBNET in
```

🔹 **Explanation**: Only traffic from `2001:DB8:1::/64` is allowed; all other IPv6 traffic is denied.

---

## 🔍 4. Verifying & Monitoring ACLs

Use the following commands to monitor ACLs and troubleshoot if needed:

- ✅ **View All ACLs**  
  ```cisco
  show access-lists
  ```

- ✅ **Check Interface ACLs**  
  ```cisco
  show ip interface GigabitEthernet0/0
  ```

- ✅ **Monitor ACL Behavior in Real-Time**  
  ```cisco
  debug ip packet detail
  ```

---

## ✅ 5. Best Practices for ACL Implementation

- ✔ **Standard ACLs → Near Destination**: Avoid unintended blocking of legitimate traffic.
- ✔ **Extended ACLs → Near Source**: Block malicious/undesired traffic early.
- ✔ **Use Named ACLs**: For better clarity and easier updates.
- ✔ **Always Remember "Implicit Deny"**: All traffic not explicitly permitted is **denied**.
- ✔ **Test ACLs in Lab First**: Prevent disruptions in live environments.
- ✔ **Log Denies for Auditing**: Add the `log` keyword to monitor denied packets.

Example:
```cisco
access-list 101 deny tcp any any eq 22 log
```

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

Access Control Lists are a powerful way to enforce policies, harden network security, and optimize performance. When planned and implemented correctly, ACLs can help protect against a wide range of threats and ensure that communication within your network aligns with business and security objectives.
