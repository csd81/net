## 🔒 **08.0. Module 08: Access Control Lists (ACLs) – Introduction**

**Access Control Lists (ACLs)** are essential tools in network security and traffic management. On Cisco devices, they allow administrators to define which **packets are allowed or denied**, offering **granular control** over traffic flow based on **IP addresses, protocols, port numbers,** and more.

---

### 🌟 1. Why Use Access Control Lists (ACLs)?

ACLs serve multiple purposes in a secure and efficient network:

- **🔐 Traffic Filtering**  
  Decide which packets are allowed into or out of an interface.

- **🔒 Security Enforcement**  
  Block unauthorized access to parts of the network (e.g., admin servers or databases).

- **🚀 Performance Optimization**  
  Prevent bandwidth-hogging or unwanted traffic (e.g., streaming services on work VLANs).

- **🛡️ DoS Mitigation**  
  Drop suspicious or malformed traffic to prevent service disruption.

- **📶 Traffic Prioritization (QoS)**  
  Although not the primary tool, ACLs can be used in Quality of Service policies to identify and prioritize traffic.

---

### 🔑 2. How ACLs Work

ACLs contain **sequential rules (statements)** that evaluate each packet **from top to bottom**. As soon as a packet matches a rule, the action (permit or deny) is applied and processing stops.

> **Implicit Deny:** Every ACL ends with an *invisible* `deny all` rule. So if traffic doesn’t match any entry, it’s denied by default.

- **Inbound ACLs** – Applied **before** traffic enters the interface.
- **Outbound ACLs** – Applied **before** traffic exits the interface.

### 📌 3. Types of ACLs

| ACL Type          | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Standard ACLs** | Use only **source IP addresses** to filter traffic.                         |
| **Extended ACLs** | Use **source/destination IPs**, **protocols**, and **port numbers**.        |
| **Numbered ACLs** | ACLs identified by numbers (e.g., 10, 101).                                 |
| **Named ACLs**    | ACLs with human-readable names for easier management.                       |
| **IPv6 ACLs**     | ACLs tailored for IPv6 networks, similar in concept to IPv4 ACLs.           |

### 🛠️ 4. Basic ACL Configuration Examples

#### ✅ Standard ACL – Block a Specific Host

```cisco
access-list 10 deny 192.168.1.100
access-list 10 permit any

interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip access-group 10 in
```

📝 This blocks **all traffic from 192.168.1.100** on inbound G0/0 while allowing everyone else.

---

#### ✅ Extended ACL – Block SSH Traffic

```cisco
access-list 101 deny tcp any any eq 22
access-list 101 permit ip any any

interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip access-group 101 in
```

📝 This blocks **SSH traffic (TCP port 22)** from any source to any destination, allowing all else.

---

### 🔍 5. ACLs in Action: Common Use Cases

- ✅ **Block Unauthorized Users**  
  Example: Drop packets from known attacker IPs.

- ✅ **Restrict Remote Management**  
  Example: Allow SSH only from IT admin subnet.

- ✅ **Filter Web Access**  
  Example: Deny port 80 (HTTP) from guest networks.

- ✅ **DoS Protection**  
  Limit access to vulnerable services or drop traffic matching attack signatures.

---

### ✅ 6. Best Practices for ACL Implementation

- **📍 Extended ACLs – Place Close to the Source:**  
  Block unnecessary traffic early to reduce load.

- **📍 Standard ACLs – Place Close to the Destination:**  
  Avoid over-filtering at the source.

- **📋 Specific Rules First:**  
  Always put **most specific matches before general ones**.

- **✔️ End with a Permit (if needed):**  
  Useful when you want to allow all remaining traffic not matched earlier.

- **🧪 Test Before Going Live:**  
  Use commands like `show access-lists`, `debug`, and `log` options for verification.
