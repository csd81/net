## 🔒 **08.1. Introduction to Access Control Lists (ACLs)**

**Access Control Lists (ACLs)** are critical tools in Cisco-based network security. They allow precise control over which traffic is allowed or denied on a network, based on various attributes like IP addresses, protocols, or port numbers. ACLs help **enforce security policies**, restrict access to sensitive areas, and optimize traffic flow.

---

### 🌟 1. Why Are ACLs Important?

ACLs enhance both **network security** and **efficiency**. Here’s why they matter:

- ✅ **Security:**  
  Prevent unauthorized users from accessing devices, servers, or services (e.g., block Internet access to internal databases).

- ✅ **Traffic Control:**  
  Reduce congestion by limiting unwanted or irrelevant traffic (e.g., block streaming sites during work hours).

- ✅ **Access Restriction:**  
  Allow only specific users or subnets (like the IT department) to access sensitive systems.

- ✅ **DoS (Denial-of-Service) Prevention:**  
  Block suspicious IPs or malformed traffic that could overwhelm network resources.

- ✅ **Policy Enforcement:**  
  Implement business or compliance policies at the edge or core of the network (e.g., no public access to internal web servers).

### 🔑 2. How Do ACLs Work?

ACLs are made up of a list of **permit** or **deny** statements. These statements are evaluated **top to bottom** and as soon as a match is found, that action is taken — the rest are ignored.

#### Matching Criteria Includes:
- 🌐 **Source IP address**
- 🛰️ **Destination IP address**
- 📦 **Protocol type:** TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.
- 🔒 **Port numbers:** e.g., TCP port 22 for SSH, port 80 for HTTP

#### ACL Behavior:
- **Inbound ACLs** → Filter packets *before* they enter the router or firewall interface.
- **Outbound ACLs** → Filter packets *before* they leave the interface.
- **Implicit Deny All** → If a packet doesn’t match *any* rule, it is silently dropped by default (even if not explicitly denied).

### 📌 3. Types of ACLs

| **ACL Type**      | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Standard ACLs** | Filter traffic based only on the **source IP address**.                         |
| **Extended ACLs** | Filter traffic using **source/destination IP**, **protocol**, and **ports**.    |
| **Numbered ACLs** | Use specific numbers (e.g., 1–99 for standard, 100–199 for extended).            |
| **Named ACLs**    | Use a descriptive name instead of numbers (easier to read/manage).              |
| **IPv6 ACLs**     | Same logic as IPv4 ACLs but tailored for **IPv6 traffic**.                      |

### 🛠️ 4. Example ACL Configurations

#### ✅ **Standard ACL – Block a Specific Host**
```cisco
access-list 10 deny 192.168.1.100
access-list 10 permit any

interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip access-group 10 in
```
🔹 This denies all traffic from host `192.168.1.100` entering through `G0/0` but allows all other traffic.

---

#### ✅ **Extended ACL – Block SSH Traffic**
```cisco
access-list 101 deny tcp any any eq 22
access-list 101 permit ip any any

interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip access-group 101 in
```
🔹 This blocks **SSH (TCP port 22)** traffic from any source to any destination. All other traffic is allowed.

---

### 🔍 5. Where Are ACLs Applied?

- **Inbound ACLs** – Filter packets **before** they enter a router interface.  
  *Example: Block external traffic before it enters your LAN.*

- **Outbound ACLs** – Filter packets **after** routing but **before** they exit the router.  
  *Example: Prevent internal users from accessing a restricted external site.*

> 💡 **Tip:** You can only apply *one ACL per direction per interface*.

### ✅ 6. Best Practices for ACL Implementation

| ✅ Best Practice               | 💬 Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Standard ACLs Close to Destination** | Since they only filter by source IP, place them close to the destination to avoid unintended blocking. |
| **Extended ACLs Close to Source**      | Since they're more granular, block bad traffic as early as possible.         |
| **Specific Rules First**               | Match the most precise (narrow) rules at the top of the ACL list.           |
| **Test Before Full Deployment**        | Always test with `show access-lists` and consider using logging options.    |
| **Remember Implicit Deny**             | Traffic that doesn't match any rule is dropped silently — plan accordingly! |
