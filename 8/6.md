## 🔒 08.6. Mitigate Attacks with ACLs (Access Control Lists)

Access Control Lists (ACLs) are one of the first lines of defense in a network. When properly configured, they act like virtual security guards on your router or switch interfaces—scrutinizing each packet and determining if it should be allowed through.

---

### 🌟 1. How ACLs Help Mitigate Attacks

ACLs can be strategically used to **harden network security** by:

- ✅ **Blocking Unauthorized Access**  
  Only known, trusted IP addresses or subnets are permitted to access sensitive devices or services (e.g., SSH, Telnet).

- ✅ **Preventing DoS/DDoS Attacks**  
  By rate-limiting or outright denying suspicious or high-volume traffic types, ACLs protect against resource exhaustion.

- ✅ **Mitigating IP Spoofing**  
  ACLs block packets from private or bogus IP addresses that should not appear on public interfaces.

- ✅ **Restricting Dangerous Traffic**  
  Specific port-based filtering helps stop malware communication channels, like IRC bots or SMB-based worms.

- ✅ **Supporting Visibility and Alerting**  
  Using the `log` keyword in ACL entries helps track attack attempts and supports forensic analysis.

### 🔑 2. Types of Attacks Mitigated by ACLs

| **Attack Type**         | **How ACLs Help** |
|-------------------------|------------------|
| **IP Spoofing**         | Block known internal/private IPs on public interfaces. |
| **DoS/DDoS**            | Drop excessive ICMP or SYN packets, especially from unknown hosts. |
| **Brute-force Attacks** | Restrict SSH/Telnet to trusted hosts only. |
| **Unauthorized Remote Access** | Allow remote admin access only from admin subnets. |
| **Malware Communication** | Block outbound ports commonly used by malware (e.g., IRC, TFTP). |

### 🛠️ 3. Configuring ACLs to Mitigate Attacks

#### ✅ 1. **Block Unauthorized Telnet & SSH Access**
Limit management access to trusted IPs only.

```cisco
access-list 110 permit tcp host 192.168.1.50 any eq 22
access-list 110 deny tcp any any eq 22
access-list 110 deny tcp any any eq 23
access-list 110 permit ip any any
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip access-group 110 in
```

🔹 This setup allows only `192.168.1.50` to SSH. All other SSH and Telnet attempts are denied.

---

#### ✅ 2. **Prevent ICMP Flood (Ping DoS)**
Limit ICMP echo requests that can flood network devices.

```cisco
access-list 120 permit icmp any any echo-reply
access-list 120 deny icmp any any echo log
access-list 120 permit ip any any
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip access-group 120 in
```

🔹 Ping replies are allowed, but incoming ping requests (echo) are dropped and logged.

---

#### ✅ 3. **Drop Spoofed Private IPs on the WAN**
Prevent internal-use IP ranges from appearing on external interfaces.

```cisco
access-list 130 deny ip 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 any
access-list 130 deny ip 172.16.0.0 0.15.255.255 any
access-list 130 deny ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255 any
access-list 130 permit ip any any
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 ip access-group 130 in
```

🔹 These ACL rules prevent IP spoofing with private IPs commonly used in spoofing attacks.

---

#### ✅ 4. **Block Common Malware Ports**
Prevent outbound access to ports used by botnets or ransomware.

```cisco
access-list 140 deny tcp any any eq 6667
access-list 140 deny tcp any any eq 445
access-list 140 deny udp any any eq 69
access-list 140 permit ip any any
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/3
 ip access-group 140 in
```

🔹 Blocks IRC (6667), SMB (445), and TFTP (69), which are often exploited.

### 🔍 4. Verifying and Monitoring ACLs

Use these commands for visibility and troubleshooting:

- **Check existing ACLs**  
  ```cisco
  show access-lists
  ```

- **Check ACL hits (match count)**  
  ```cisco
  show ip access-lists
  ```

- **Monitor packet flow**  
  ```cisco
  debug ip packet detail
  ```

- **Log denied traffic**  
  Add `log` to an ACL entry:  
  ```cisco
  access-list 150 deny ip any any log
  ```

---

### ✅ 5. Best Practices for ACL-Based Attack Mitigation

✔ **Default Deny**: Permit only known good traffic.  
✔ **Use Logging**: Monitor denied traffic for threat intelligence.  
✔ **Place ACLs Strategically**: 
- Inbound = Block external attacks.
- Outbound = Prevent internal misuse or infections.  
✔ **Keep Rules Updated**: Adapt to new threats (e.g., block new C2 ports).  
✔ **Limit Sensitive Ports**: Restrict access to SSH, RDP, SNMP, etc.  
✔ **Use Rate Limiting When Possible**: Helps absorb traffic surges without full blockage.

### 🚀 Final Thoughts

ACLs, when thoughtfully crafted and deployed, are a powerful weapon in a network administrator’s toolkit. They help **prevent, detect, and contain** attacks by enforcing clear boundaries and filtering dangerous traffic. Paired with logging and regular audits, ACLs support both proactive security and reactive incident response.
