### 🔧 08.5. Implement ACLs (Access Control Lists)

Access Control Lists (ACLs) play a crucial role in enforcing security policies and controlling traffic flow in Cisco networks. However, even a well-written ACL is ineffective unless it's correctly implemented. This means applying the ACL to the right interface and in the right direction—*without blocking legitimate traffic*.

---

### 🌟 1. Steps to Implement ACLs

1️⃣ **Create the ACL**  
   - Use either numbered or named syntax to define rules that permit or deny traffic.
   - Determine whether to use a **Standard**, **Extended**, or **IPv6** ACL.

2️⃣ **Apply the ACL to an Interface**  
   - Decide on **inbound** (filter as traffic enters the interface) or **outbound** (as it exits).

3️⃣ **Verify ACL Operation**  
   - Use commands to ensure ACLs are correctly configured and functioning.
   - Monitor logs and use test packets to confirm the expected behavior.

### 🔑 2. Where to Apply ACLs?

| ACL Type | Placement Strategy | Reason |
|----------|--------------------|--------|
| **Standard ACL** | **Near the destination** | Filters only source IP. Avoids dropping legitimate traffic too early. |
| **Extended ACL** | **Near the source** | More precise filtering by protocol/port. Stops unwanted traffic before it traverses the network. |
| **Inbound** | Applied to traffic **entering** the interface | Useful for blocking early, saves bandwidth. |
| **Outbound** | Applied to traffic **leaving** the interface | Often used for final enforcement at edge routers. |

---

### 🛠️ 3. Implementing a Standard ACL

**🔹 Goal**: Block all traffic from host `192.168.1.100` on interface `G0/0`.

```cisco
access-list 10 deny 192.168.1.100
access-list 10 permit any
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip access-group 10 in
```

✅ **Explanation**:
- The ACL denies traffic from `192.168.1.100`.
- The `permit any` line ensures other traffic is allowed.
- The ACL is applied *inbound* to filter traffic entering `G0/0`.

---

### 🛠️ 4. Implementing an Extended ACL

**🔹 Goal**: Block SSH (`TCP port 22`) and HTTP (`TCP port 80`) traffic.

```cisco
access-list 101 deny tcp any any eq 22
access-list 101 deny tcp any any eq 80
access-list 101 permit ip any any
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip access-group 101 in
```

✅ **Explanation**:
- This ACL blocks SSH and HTTP traffic from all sources to all destinations.
- Remaining IP traffic is permitted.
- Apply *closer to the source* to avoid wasting bandwidth.

---

### 🛠️ 5. Implementing a Named ACL

**🔹 Goal**: Block all outbound traffic from subnet `192.168.10.0/24`.

```cisco
ip access-list extended BLOCK_SUBNET
 deny ip 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip any any
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 ip access-group BLOCK_SUBNET out
```

✅ **Explanation**:
- Named ACL `BLOCK_SUBNET` denies traffic from the specified subnet.
- The ACL is applied *outbound* on `G0/2`.

---

### 🔍 6. Verifying ACL Implementation

- **Check all ACLs**:  
  ```cisco
  show access-lists
  ```

- **Check interface ACL application**:  
  ```cisco
  show ip interface GigabitEthernet0/0
  ```

- **Monitor real-time ACL activity**:  
  ```cisco
  debug ip packet detail
  ```

---

### ✅ 7. Best Practices for Implementing ACLs

- ✔ Apply **Standard ACLs close to the destination** to prevent overblocking.
- ✔ Apply **Extended ACLs close to the source** to stop unnecessary traffic early.
- ✔ Ensure **correct direction** (in or out) when applying to interfaces.
- ✔ **Log and monitor** ACLs to track and troubleshoot issues.
- ✔ **Backup configs** before applying new ACLs in production environments.
- ✔ **Use named ACLs** for better readability and easier modifications.

### 🚀 Final Thoughts

Correctly implementing ACLs is just as important as writing them. Poor placement or direction can lead to serious network disruptions. Always test in a lab or on a non-critical interface first, and validate with `show` and `debug` commands.
