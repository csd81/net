# 🔧 12.3. Configure Snort IPS

**Cisco Snort IPS** is an open-source intrusion prevention system that offers **real-time monitoring, detection, and threat blocking**. A proper configuration ensures effective protection and network visibility.

---

## 🌟 1. Prerequisites for Snort IPS Configuration

✅ A **Linux-based system** (Ubuntu/Debian) or **Cisco Firepower device**  
✅ **Root or admin access** to install and configure packages  
✅ **Internet connectivity** for downloading rule updates  
✅ A **monitored network interface** (e.g., eth0, ens33)

---

## 🔑 2. Install and Set Up Snort

### ✅ Step 1: Install Snort on Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install snort -y
```
🔹 Installs Snort and dependencies from the official package repository.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Verify the Installation
```bash
snort -V
```
🔹 Confirms that Snort is installed and displays the version info.

---

## 🛠️ 3. Configuring Snort for Network Monitoring

### ✅ Step 3: Identify the Monitoring Interface
```bash
ip a
```
🔹 Lists all interfaces; choose the one connected to your monitored network (e.g., `eth0`).

---

### ✅ Step 4: Start Snort on a Specific Interface
```bash
snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
```
🔹 Launches Snort with your configuration file, monitoring `eth0`.

---

### ✅ Step 5: Edit the Snort Configuration File
Open `/etc/snort/snort.conf` and update network variables:
```bash
var HOME_NET [192.168.1.0/24]
var EXTERNAL_NET any
```
🔹 Defines internal and external network scopes for rule accuracy.

---

## 🔥 4. Configuring Snort IPS Rules

Rules are located in:  
```bash
/etc/snort/rules/
```

### ✅ ICMP (Ping) Attack Detection
**File:** `/etc/snort/rules/local.rules`
```plaintext
alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ICMP Ping Attack Detected"; sid:100001; rev:1;)
```

---

### ✅ SSH Brute Force Detection
```plaintext
alert tcp any any -> any 22 (msg:"SSH Brute Force Attack"; flags:S; sid:100002; rev:1;)
```

---

### ✅ SQL Injection Detection
```plaintext
alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg:"SQL Injection Detected"; content:"UNION SELECT"; nocase; sid:100003; rev:1;)
```

---

## 🔍 5. Running and Testing Snort IPS

### ✅ Step 6: Test Snort Configuration
```bash
snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
```
🔹 Validates your configuration for syntax errors.

---

### ✅ Step 7: Run Snort in IPS Mode
```bash
snort -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0 -Q
```
🔹 Activates inline mode with real-time alert output to the console.

---

### ✅ Step 8: Simulate Traffic for Testing
```bash
ping -c 4 192.168.1.1
```
🔹 Sends ICMP packets that should trigger alerts if detection is working.

---

## 📌 6. Monitoring Snort IPS Activity

### ✅ View Alert Logs
```bash
cat /var/log/snort/alert
```
🔹 Displays all triggered alerts and detected threats.

---

### ✅ Check Snort DAQ Module and Performance Info
```bash
snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf --daq list
```
🔹 Shows available data acquisition modules and performance options.

---

## ✅ 7. Best Practices for Snort IPS Configuration

✔ **Enable automatic rule updates** – Use tools like `PulledPork` or `Oinkmaster`  
✔ **Fine-tune rules** – Avoid false positives by adjusting thresholds and filters  
✔ **Enable logging and alerting** – Real-time visibility into threat activity  
✔ **Use with Cisco Firepower** – Gain NGFW capabilities for deeper packet inspection  
✔ **Integrate with SIEM tools** – Enhance detection, correlation, and response

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

**Cisco Snort IPS** is a powerful and flexible tool for **protecting networks** from cyber threats. With proper installation, custom rules, and regular updates, Snort can deliver **robust, real-time intrusion prevention** for any environment.
