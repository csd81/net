Here’s a polished and well-structured version of **Module 12.2: Cisco Snort IPS**, perfect for study, teaching, or professional documentation:

# 🔥 12.2. Cisco Snort IPS

**Snort IPS**, developed by **Cisco**, is a powerful, open-source intrusion prevention system that uses **signature-based**, **anomaly-based**, and **behavioral detection** to identify and block cyber threats in real time.

---

## 🌟 1. Why Use Cisco Snort IPS?

✅ **Real-Time Threat Prevention** – Detects and stops malicious activity dynamically  
✅ **Signature & Anomaly Detection** – Uses known attack patterns and AI techniques  
✅ **Customizable Rules** – Admins can write rules tailored to their environment  
✅ **Open-Source & Community-Supported** – Continuously updated with new threats  
✅ **Integrated with Cisco Firepower** – Provides NGFW and IPS capabilities

---

## 🔑 2. How Cisco Snort IPS Works

Snort operates by **inspecting packets** in real time, applying rules to detect known attack patterns, and taking appropriate actions.

### ✅ Snort IPS Traffic Flow:

1️⃣ Traffic enters the network  
2️⃣ Snort **analyzes each packet**  
3️⃣ If a threat is detected:  
- 🚫 **Drop** the packet (prevent delivery)  
- 🚨 **Alert** the admin/log system  
- 🔄 **Block the attacker's IP address**  
4️⃣ Legitimate traffic proceeds to its destination

### 📌 Snort IPS Actions:
- **Pass** – Allows legitimate traffic  
- **Drop** – Silently blocks malicious packets  
- **Alert** – Sends logs or alerts to administrators  
- **Reject** – Blocks and sends TCP RST (connection reset) to source

## 🛠️ 3. Installing and Configuring Cisco Snort IPS

### ✅ Step 1: Install Snort (Linux-Based Systems)
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install snort -y
```
🔹 *Installs Snort and dependencies.*

---

### ✅ Step 2: Verify Installation
```bash
snort -V
```
🔹 *Displays Snort version and build info.*

---

### ✅ Step 3: Start Snort in IPS Mode
```bash
sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
```
🔹 *Runs Snort using the main config file on interface `eth0`.*

---

### ✅ Step 4: Enable Default Rule Sets in Configuration
Edit `/etc/snort/snort.conf` to include:
```bash
include $RULE_PATH/community.rules
include $RULE_PATH/emerging-threats.rules
```
🔹 *Uses free and updated threat detection rules.*

---

## 🔥 4. Writing Custom Snort IPS Rules

### ✅ Block ICMP (Ping) Flood
```plaintext
alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ICMP Ping Flood Detected"; sid:100001; rev:1;)
```

---

### ✅ Block Unauthorized SSH Login Attempts
```plaintext
alert tcp any any -> any 22 (msg:"Unauthorized SSH Login Attempt"; flags:S; sid:100002; rev:1;)
```

---

### ✅ Block SQL Injection
```plaintext
alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg:"SQL Injection Attack"; content:"UNION SELECT"; nocase; sid:100003; rev:1;)
```

---

## 🔍 5. Monitoring & Logging Snort IPS Activity

### ✅ View Logs
```bash
cat /var/log/snort/alert
```
🔹 *Shows recorded alerts and blocked activity.*

---

### ✅ Run Snort in Test Mode
```bash
snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
```
🔹 *Validates config syntax before deployment.*

---

### ✅ Run Snort in Daemon Mode
```bash
snort -D -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
```
🔹 *Runs Snort as a background service.*

---

## ✅ 6. Best Practices for Snort IPS Deployment

✔ **Use up-to-date signature sets** – Stay protected against latest threats  
✔ **Tune custom rules** – Minimize false positives  
✔ **Enable logging and alerting** – Monitor for trends and incident response  
✔ **Integrate with SIEM** – Centralize visibility and correlate events  
✔ **Pair with Cisco Firepower** – For advanced DPI and NGFW capabilities

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

**Cisco Snort IPS** is a **versatile, open-source tool** that provides **real-time threat detection and prevention**. With its rich rule set, customization features, and integration with next-gen security platforms, Snort helps organizations stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.
