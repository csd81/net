Here's an **expanded and detailed breakdown** of 🔑 **05.0. Assigning Administrative Roles** — perfect for learning, reviewing, or implementing in a secure network environment like your GNS3 lab:

---

## 🔑 **05.0 – Introduction: Assigning Administrative Roles**

In secure networks, **not all users should have full administrative rights**. Delegating permissions based on job function strengthens security and improves efficiency. This is based on the **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** — users get only the access they need, nothing more.

---

### 🌟 1. **Why Assign Administrative Roles?**

| Objective | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| ✅ **Improved Security** | Reduces the attack surface and prevents misuse of powerful commands. |
| ✅ **Operational Efficiency** | Streamlines admin workflows by limiting access to relevant tasks. |
| ✅ **Accountability & Auditing** | Each action can be traced to a specific individual. |
| ✅ **Compliance** | Many standards (like PCI-DSS, HIPAA) require role-based controls.

---

### 🔒 2. **Key Concepts in Role Assignment**

#### 🔧 **Cisco Privilege Levels (0–15)**

- **Level 0** – Only: `disable`, `enable`, `exit`, `logout`
- **Level 1** – Basic read-only (user EXEC mode)
- **Level 15** – Full control (privileged EXEC mode)
- **Levels 2–14** – Customizable intermediate levels for restricted tasks

> 🧠 Example:
> You can allow a junior admin to view interfaces and restart a router without letting them change routing settings.

#### 🎭 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

- Define roles with a **specific set of commands**
- Assign users to roles instead of manually managing privileges per user
- Can be configured **locally** or via **AAA server**

#### 🔐 **AAA: Authentication, Authorization, Accounting**

- **Authentication** – Who are you?
- **Authorization** – What can you do?
- **Accounting** – What did you do?
- Works best with **TACACS+** (granular command-level authorization)

---

### ⚙️ 3. **Best Practices for Role Assignment**

| Best Practice | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| 🔒 **Least Privilege** | Only assign what the user absolutely needs. No unnecessary privileges. |
| 👤 **Individual Accounts** | Prevent shared logins. Ensure accountability. |
| 🔐 **Strong Passwords & MFA** | Enforce complexity and use 2FA where possible. |
| 📋 **Monitor & Log** | Use Syslog/SNMP/AAA to log every config and login event. |
| 🔄 **Review Roles** | Periodically audit and update user roles as job functions change.

---

### 📊 4. **Implementation Methods**

#### 🛠️ **Using Privilege Levels**

Example: Allow users with privilege level 5 to run `show` and `reload` only:

```cisco
privilege exec level 5 show
privilege exec level 5 reload
```

Assign privilege level to user:
```cisco
username support privilege 5 secret SupportPass123
```

#### 🎭 **Using Role-Based CLI (on newer IOS platforms)**

```cisco
role name NETOPS
  command exec include show
  command exec include ping
  command exec include traceroute
```

Assign the role:
```cisco
username netadmin role NETOPS secret NetOpsPass456
```

> 💡 **Role-Based CLI is available on IOS XE and some IOS versions.**

#### 🔗 **AAA Server Integration (TACACS+)**

- Centralize access control
- Authorize by **TACACS+ command sets** or **shell roles**
- Great for enterprise environments and GNS3 lab AAA testing

---

### ✅ 5. **Summary of Benefits**

| Benefit       | Explanation |
|---------------|-------------|
| 🔐 **Security** | Minimizes risk by controlling access to powerful commands. |
| 📋 **Accountability** | Each user’s action is logged and traceable. |
| ⚙️ **Efficiency** | Streamlines daily operations by giving users only what they need. |
| 📜 **Compliance** | Satisfies regulations that require access control and auditing. |

Awesome, Daniel! Here's an **expanded guide** to 🔒 **05.1. Configure Privilege Levels** — tailored for Cisco IOS and perfect for integrating into your GNS3 lab with TACACS+ and RBAC.

---

## 🔒 05.1 – Configure Privilege Levels (Expanded)

**Privilege levels** in Cisco IOS provide a simple yet powerful method to define who can do what on a device. Combined with AAA and logging, they’re key to secure device access.

---

### 🌟 1. Why Configure Privilege Levels?

| 🔐 Benefit            | 💬 Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Enhanced Security** | Limits access to sensitive or risky commands (e.g., `reload`, `write`, `conf t`). |
| **Role-Based Access** | Assigns different capabilities to users like `support`, `netops`, `viewer`.     |
| **Accountability**    | Makes auditing easier by tying actions to specific privilege levels.           |

---

### ⚙️ 2. Configuring Privilege Levels

#### 🧑‍💻 2.1. Create Users with Specific Levels

```cisco
username admin privilege 15 secret AdminPass123
username support privilege 5 secret SupportPass123
username viewonly privilege 1 secret ViewPass!
```

- `15`: Full administrative access
- `5`: Limited operator functions
- `1`: Basic read-only access

---

#### 🔧 2.2. Assign Commands to Custom Levels

Assign specific commands to intermediate levels. Examples:

**Example: Level 5 can view configs**
```cisco
privilege exec level 5 show running-config
```

**Example: Level 7 can configure interfaces**
```cisco
privilege exec level 7 configure terminal
privilege exec level 7 interface
```

> 🧠 Pro tip: To see what’s available at each level, run:  
> `show privilege`  
> `show running-config | include privilege`

---

#### 🔐 2.3. Set Enable Passwords for Each Level

```cisco
enable secret level 5 SupportEnable123
enable secret level 7 InterfaceTech
```

> 🔐 Now users can type:
> ```
> enable 5
> (password prompt)
> ```

---

#### 🌐 2.4. Limit Remote Access Based on Level

```cisco
line vty 0 4
 login local
 privilege level 5
 transport input ssh
```

> Only users with privilege level **5 or higher** can log in via SSH.

---

### 🔍 3. Verification and Testing

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Check privilege level after login | `show privilege` |
| Test command access | Try `show run`, `conf t`, `interface` depending on user level |
| View users and their levels | `show running-config | include username` |

---

### 📊 4. Monitoring and Logging

```cisco
logging buffered 10000
login on-success log
login on-failure log
```

- All login activity gets logged
- Use `show logging` to review logs

---

### ✅ 5. Summary of Key Commands

| Task                         | Example Command                                       |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Create User with Priv Level  | `username admin privilege 15 secret Admin123`         |
| Assign Command to Level      | `privilege exec level 5 show running-config`          |
| Set Enable Password          | `enable secret level 5 SupportPass123`                |
| Restrict VTY Priv Level      | `privilege level 5` in `line vty 0 4`                 |
| Verify Privilege Level       | `show privilege`                                      |

---

### ⚔️ 6. Troubleshooting Tips

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| ❌ “Access denied” | User lacks privilege for the command. Use `show privilege` to verify. |
| ❌ “Command not found” | Command not assigned to user’s level. Use `privilege exec level X` to assign. |
| 🔒 Prompted for enable password | Enable password missing for the desired level. Add `enable secret level X` |

---

### 🌟 7. Benefits Recap

| Benefit              | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔐 **Granular Access**   | Allow specific users to run only necessary commands (e.g., `show`, `interface`). |
| 🚫 **Improved Security** | Restrict access to critical config like `reload`, `copy run start`.         |
| 🧩 **Efficiency**         | Let different teams (NOC, Helpdesk, Ops) focus on their own tools.          |
| 📋 **Auditability**      | Track user roles and commands executed for compliance.                      |

---

### ⚙️ 2. Key Concepts

| Term        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Root View** | Required to create/manage other views — equivalent to full admin.          |
| **Parser View** | A named view (role) with explicitly permitted commands.                   |
| **CLI Views** | Group of commands available to a user.                                      |
| **AAA**     | Must be enabled to support views and user-role linking.                     |

---

### 🛠️ 3. Configuration Steps

#### ✅ 3.1. Enable AAA

```cisco
aaa new-model
```

---

#### 🔓 3.2. Enable Root View

```cisco
enable view
enable secret strongpassword123
```

- `enable view`: Activates root view system.
- `enable secret`: Secures root view access (required to create/manage views).

---

#### 🧑‍🔧 3.3. Create a New View (Role)

```cisco
parser view NetworkSupport
 secret SupportPass123
```

- `parser view`: Creates a role/view.
- `secret`: View password (not the same as a user password).

---

#### ✍️ 3.4. Assign Commands to the View

```cisco
view NetworkSupport
 command exec include show
 command exec include configure terminal
 command exec include interface
```

- You can be as specific as needed (e.g., `show interfaces status`, `show ip route`).
- The view **includes only what you specify** — all else is denied by default.

---

#### 👥 3.5. Create Users and Assign Views

```cisco
username admin privilege 15 secret AdminPass123
username support view NetworkSupport secret SupportPass123
```

- User `support` can only use commands in `NetworkSupport` view.
- `admin` remains a full-access user.

---

#### 🌐 3.6. Apply to Remote Access (VTY)

```cisco
line vty 0 4
 login local
 transport input ssh
```

- The view is automatically applied when the user logs in via SSH or console.

---
