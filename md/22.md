## üîê 22.0. Module 22: Network Security Testing - Introduction

Network security testing is a critical practice in modern cybersecurity that helps organizations ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of their networks. In an era where cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent, testing a network‚Äôs security isn‚Äôt just advisable ‚Äî it‚Äôs essential. This module explores the key concepts, methods, tools, and benefits of network security testing.

The goal of network security testing is to proactively identify and remediate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers. It involves a comprehensive examination of the network infrastructure, including hardware devices, software applications, communication protocols, and security policies.

By using both manual and automated techniques, organizations can uncover misconfigurations, outdated software, weak access controls, and other security gaps. In addition to reducing risk, these efforts support compliance with industry regulations, internal security standards, and external audit requirements.
