## 🛠️ **3. Key Cryptographic Techniques for Ensuring Confidentiality**

---

### ✅ **1. Encryption**

Encryption is the **most widely used method** for ensuring confidentiality. It transforms readable data into ciphertext using an algorithm and a key, ensuring only authorized parties can decrypt it.

#### 🔐 Types of Encryption:
- **Symmetric Encryption:** Uses the **same key** for encryption and decryption.
  - Algorithms: **AES**, **ChaCha20**
- **Asymmetric Encryption:** Uses a **public key to encrypt** and a **private key to decrypt**.
  - Algorithms: **RSA**, **ECC**

#### 🧪 **Example: AES Encryption with Python**
```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes

key = get_random_bytes(16)
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC)
data = b"This is some secret data."
ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(pad(data, AES.block_size))
print(f"Ciphertext: {ciphertext.hex()}")
```
🔹 *AES ensures confidentiality by converting data into a secure format that unauthorized users cannot interpret.*

---

### ✅ **2. Access Control**

Access control restricts **who** can view or interact with specific systems, files, or functions.

#### Types:
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** Assigns access based on user roles (e.g., admin, HR, finance).
- **DAC (Discretionary Access Control):** Resource owners define permissions.
- **MAC (Mandatory Access Control):** Access decisions are enforced by a central authority based on policies and classifications.

#### 💡 **Linux Example: RBAC**
```bash
usermod -aG admin user1
```
🔹 *This command adds `user1` to the `admin` group, granting elevated access rights.*

---

### ✅ **3. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**

PKI uses cryptographic **key pairs and digital certificates** to:
- **Encrypt** data for secure transmission.
- **Authenticate** the identity of senders and receivers.
- **Secure** email, websites, documents, and file transfers.

#### 📄 **Example: Generating a TLS Certificate**
```bash
# Generate a certificate signing request
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
# Sign the certificate
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -out server.crt
```
🔹 *These steps create a signed TLS certificate, enabling encrypted communication over HTTPS.*
