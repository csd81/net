Here’s a **comprehensive and detailed breakdown** of **🚫 02.5. Network Attacks Overview**, covering **DoS/DDoS**, **Buffer Overflow Attacks**, **Evasion Techniques**, and **Defense Strategies**. This is foundational material for understanding how attacks work and how to defend against them.

---

## 🚫 **02.5. Network Attacks Overview**

> **Goal of Network Attacks**:  
To **disrupt services**, **steal data**, or **bypass security defenses**.

This section includes:

- Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks  
- Buffer overflow attacks  
- Evasion techniques used to slip past firewalls, IDS/IPS  
- Defense strategies

---

### ⚔️ 1. **Denial of Service (DoS) & Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks**

#### 📌 What is a DoS Attack?
A **DoS attack** is when an attacker overwhelms a system with excessive traffic or malicious data, making it **unavailable to legitimate users**.

---

### 🧱 1.1. **Types of DoS Attacks**

#### 💣 Overwhelming Traffic
- The attacker floods the target system or network with **high volumes of traffic**.
- Causes the target to become slow, unresponsive, or crash.
- **Examples**:  
  - **ICMP Flood** (ping flood)  
  - **Ping of Death** (oversized packets crash systems)

#### 🧬 Maliciously Formatted Packets
- The attacker sends specially crafted packets that **exploit bugs in packet handling**.
- **Example**:  
  - **Teardrop Attack** – Sends malformed fragmented IP packets that crash older OSes.

---

### 🌐 1.2. **Distributed DoS (DDoS)**

A **DDoS attack** uses many compromised devices (**botnet**) to launch a **coordinated flood of traffic** at a target.

#### 🔗 DDoS Components:
| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Attacker** | The originator of the DDoS campaign |
| **Handler/C2 Server** | Commands and controls botnets |
| **Zombies (Bots)** | Infected devices used to attack the victim |
| **Victim** | The targeted server or network resource |

#### 🧠 Example: **Mirai Botnet**
- Infected IoT devices (like routers and cameras) using default credentials.
- Launched massive DDoS attacks on DNS providers, crippling large parts of the internet.

---

### 🔄 1.3. **Common DDoS Attack Types**

| Attack Type | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Volumetric** | Floods bandwidth with junk data | UDP Flood, ICMP Flood |
| **Protocol** | Exploits weaknesses in protocols | SYN Flood (TCP handshake abuse) |
| **Application Layer** | Targets specific apps (like HTTP servers) | HTTP Flood |

---

### 🛡️ 1.4. **Mitigation Techniques for DoS/DDoS**

| Technique | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|

| **Blackholing** | Drops malicious traffic by routing it to null addresses |
| **DDoS Mitigation Services** | Cloud services (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai) that filter traffic |
| **IPS** | Detects and blocks suspicious traffic in real-time |
| **Firmware Updates** | Fix protocol bugs and vulnerabilities |

---

## 🖥️ 2. **Buffer Overflow Attacks**

#### 💥 What is a Buffer Overflow?
- A buffer is a **temporary storage area in memory**.
- If a program writes **more data** to the buffer than it can hold, it can **overwrite adjacent memory**.
- This can cause a **crash** or let an attacker **inject malicious code**.

#### 🧪 How it works:
1. Program allocates buffer (e.g., 256 bytes).
2. Attacker sends 512 bytes.
3. The extra 256 bytes overflow into **code or return address memory**.
4. Attacker places a **payload** that gets executed.

#### ⚠️ Example: **SQL Slammer Worm**
- Exploited a buffer overflow in Microsoft SQL Server.
- Caused massive internet slowdowns in 2003.

#### 🔐 Mitigation Techniques:
| Technique | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Input Validation** | Check size/type of user input before processing |
| **ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)** | Randomizes memory layout to block predictable targeting |
| **DEP (Data Execution Prevention)** | Prevents execution in data-only memory areas |
| **Patching** | Regular updates close buffer overflow vulnerabilities |

---

## 🕵️ 3. **Evasion Techniques**

Used by attackers to **avoid detection** by security systems like firewalls, IDS, antivirus.

| Technique | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Fragmentation** | Splits payloads into small parts so they evade reassembly-based inspection | Evades packet filters |
| **Encryption** | Encrypted payloads can't be scanned | **SSL/TLS tunneling** |
| **Obfuscation** | Malware changes its code to avoid signature-based detection | **Polymorphic/Metamorphic malware** |
| **Traffic Flooding** | Overwhelms IDS with normal traffic, hiding malicious activity |
| **Steganography** | Hides malicious code in images, audio, or documents | Malware in .jpg files |

---

## 🔐 4. **Defense Against Network Attacks**
