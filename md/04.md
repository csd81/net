## 🧾 **Secure Device Access – Cisco Configuration Cheat Sheet**

---

### 🔐 1. **SSH Configuration (Secure Remote Access)**

```cisco
! Set hostname and domain name (required for key generation)
hostname R1
ip domain-name secure.lab

! Generate RSA keys (2048-bit recommended)
crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048

! Create a local user account
username admin privilege 15 secret StrongP@ss123

! Enable SSH version 2
ip ssh version 2

! Configure VTY lines to use SSH only and local login
line vty 0 4
 login local
 transport input ssh
 exec-timeout 10 0
```

✅ **Tips**:
- Avoid Telnet (`transport input telnet`).
- Use `privilege 15` for full admin access (customize as needed).

---

### 🛡️ 2. **AAA Configuration (with Local or Remote Authentication)**

#### 🔹 Local AAA (no external server):

```cisco
! Enable AAA
aaa new-model

! Define local login method
aaa authentication login default local

! Apply to VTY lines
line vty 0 4
 login authentication default
```

#### 🔹 AAA with RADIUS (example):

```cisco
! Enable AAA
aaa new-model

! Define RADIUS server
radius-server host 192.168.10.10 key radiusSECRET

! Use RADIUS for login
aaa authentication login default group radius local
aaa authorization exec default group radius local
aaa accounting exec default start-stop group radius
```

✅ **Notes**:
- Fallback to `local` if RADIUS fails.
- Replace with `group tacacs+` if using TACACS+.

---

### 🧱 3. **Access Control List (ACL) for SSH Access Control**

```cisco
! Permit only one trusted host (management PC) to access via SSH
ip access-list standard SSH_ACCESS
 permit 192.168.1.100
 deny any

! Apply ACL to VTY lines
line vty 0 4
 access-class SSH_ACCESS in
```

✅ Use this to **lock down remote management** to specific IPs.

---

### 📜 4. **Syslog and Logging Configuration**

```cisco
! Set logging level and destination
logging 192.168.1.200           ! Syslog server IP
logging trap informational
logging buffered 4096
service timestamps log datetime msec

! Enable logging for console and monitor
line con 0
 logging synchronous

line vty 0 4
 logging synchronous
```

✅ Log everything from login attempts to configuration changes.

---

### 📦 5. **Bonus: Password Encryption (Local Security)**

```cisco
! Encrypt plain-text passwords
service password-encryption

! Use 'secret' keyword for better encryption
enable secret SuperS3cret!
```

### 🔄 Optional for Your GNS3 Lab

Since your lab includes **TACACS+ and Syslog**, I’ll ensure:

- The router uses `aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ local`
- VTY lines use `login authentication default`
- Logs from SSH logins appear on your **Syslog server**
- ACLs protect SSH against unauthorized networks

Would you like me to:
- Include **SSH public key auth** (no passwords)?
- Create a **test PC image** in the lab to SSH in from?
- Add a **login attack simulation** to test retry protection?

Let me know and I’ll include it all in your GNS3 project!



Here's an **expanded English version** of the 🔒 **04.5. Secure Device Access Summary**, with detailed breakdowns and real-world context to reinforce the importance and practical implementation:

---

## 🔒 **04.5. Secure Device Access – Full Summary (Expanded)**

Securing device access is a fundamental aspect of network security. It involves applying strong security controls to **prevent unauthorized users** from configuring or disrupting network infrastructure. This includes using encryption, authentication mechanisms, access control lists (ACLs), and monitoring to **ensure only trusted users can make changes**.

---

### 🛡️ 1. **Key Components of Secure Device Access**

| Component      | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Authentication** | Confirms the identity of users trying to access the device. |
| **Authorization**  | Determines what actions a user is allowed to perform (based on roles or privilege levels). |
| **Accounting**     | Tracks and logs user actions for auditing, troubleshooting, and forensic purposes. |
| **Encryption**     | Ensures that communication between users and network devices is secure and cannot be intercepted. |
| **Access Control** | Restricts who can access the device, from where, and through which interfaces (e.g., console, VTY, AUX). |

---

### 🔑 2. **Best Practices for Securing Device Access**

| Area | Practice |
|------|----------|
| **Encrypted Access** | Replace insecure Telnet with **SSH** for all remote access. Use **HTTPS** for web-based interfaces. |
| **Strong Authentication** | Enforce **strong passwords** and **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**. Use **local accounts** or integrate with **AAA servers** (TACACS+ or RADIUS). |
| **Access Restriction** | Use **ACLs** to allow access only from known IP ranges. Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for task-specific permissions. |
| **Session Management** | Set **exec-timeout** on idle sessions. Use `login block-for` to prevent brute-force attacks. |
| **Monitoring and Logging** | Log successful and failed login attempts. Forward logs to a **Syslog server** and monitor activity using SNMP. |

---

### 🛠️ 3. **Key Configuration Steps for Cisco Devices**

These commands are commonly used on Cisco IOS-based devices to implement secure access.

---

#### **3.1. Configure Secure Passwords**

```cisco
enable secret strongpassword123
service password-encryption
```

🔒 Protects the privileged EXEC mode and encrypts all plaintext passwords in the running configuration.

---

#### **3.2. Enable SSH for Remote Access**

```cisco
hostname Router1
ip domain-name example.com
crypto key generate rsa
ip ssh version 2

line vty 0 4
 transport input ssh
 login local
 exec-timeout 10 0
```

🔐 Configures secure remote access using SSH instead of Telnet. Also includes session timeout for inactive connections.

---

#### **3.3. Create Local User Accounts**

```cisco
username admin privilege 15 secret AdminPass123
username support privilege 5 secret SupportPass123
```

👤 Assigns different users different levels of access. Privilege 15 users have full administrative rights.

---

#### **3.4. Restrict Access with ACLs**

```cisco
ip access-list standard SSH_ACCESS
 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
 deny any

line vty 0 4
 access-class SSH_ACCESS in
```

📶 Prevents login attempts from unknown or untrusted IP addresses.

---

#### **3.5. Enable Login Attack Prevention**

```cisco
login block-for 120 attempts 3 within 60
```

🛑 Locks out login access temporarily after a number of failed attempts — helps stop brute-force attacks.

---

#### **3.6. Set Session Timeout**

```cisco
line vty 0 4
 exec-timeout 10 0
```

⏱️ Disconnects idle remote sessions after 10 minutes.

---

#### **3.7. Enable Logging**

```cisco
logging buffered 10000
login on-success log
login on-failure log
```

📝 Logs both successful and failed logins to local memory. Recommended for integration with Syslog servers.

---

### 📊 4. **Verification and Monitoring**

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Verify SSH status | `show ip ssh` |
| View user accounts | `show running-config | section username` |
| Check login failures | `show login failures` |
