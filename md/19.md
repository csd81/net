## 🔐 19.2. ISAKMP Policy

### Overview  
ISAKMP (Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol) is a key component of IPsec VPNs, responsible for managing the negotiation and establishment of Security Associations (SAs) between devices. It serves as the framework for Internet Key Exchange (IKE), a protocol used to securely negotiate encryption keys and security settings.

An **ISAKMP policy** defines the rules and parameters that govern how two IPsec peers establish a secure communication channel during the IKE Phase 1 negotiation. These settings must match on both peers for the VPN connection to be successfully established.

---

## 🌟 1. What is an ISAKMP Policy?

An ISAKMP policy is a configuration on VPN-capable devices (such as routers, firewalls, and security appliances) that dictates how the initial IKE Phase 1 negotiations are carried out. These policies ensure both devices agree on key cryptographic settings—such as encryption and hashing algorithms, authentication method, and key exchange mechanisms—before any secure communication can take place.

### ✅ Key Components of an ISAKMP Policy:

1. **Encryption Algorithm**: Defines how data is encrypted during negotiation (e.g., AES-256, 3DES).  
2. **Hashing Algorithm**: Ensures data integrity and authenticity (e.g., SHA-256, MD5).  
3. **Authentication Method**: Determines how peers verify each other (e.g., PSK, digital certificates).  
4. **Diffie-Hellman Group**: Specifies the strength of the key exchange (e.g., Group 14).  
5. **Lifetime**: Determines the validity duration of the keys before requiring renegotiation.

---

## ✅ 2. ISAKMP Policy Elements

### 1. Encryption Algorithm  
Determines how sensitive data is encrypted during negotiation. Stronger algorithms enhance security but may impact performance.

**Examples:**
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: Modern, secure (e.g., AES-256).
- **3DES (Triple DES)**: Legacy method, less secure, higher overhead.

---

### 2. Hashing Algorithm  
Verifies that data has not been modified during transmission.

**Examples:**
- **SHA-256**: Strong, widely recommended.
- **MD5**: Weak, deprecated due to vulnerabilities.

---

### 3. Authentication Method  
Validates the identity of the devices during IKE negotiation.

**Options:**
- **Pre-shared Key (PSK)**: Simple shared secret; easier to configure, but less secure.
- **Digital Certificates**: Issued by trusted CAs; scalable and more secure.

---

### 4. Diffie-Hellman Group  
Specifies how cryptographic keys are generated and exchanged.

**Groups:**
- **Group 1 (768-bit)**: Weak, obsolete.
- **Group 2 (1024-bit)**: Minimum acceptable, but outdated.
- **Group 14 (2048-bit)**: Recommended for secure VPNs.
- **Group 24 (2048-bit Elliptic Curve)**: Advanced and secure, ideal for high-security environments.

---

### 5. Lifetime  
Defines the validity duration (in seconds) of the Security Association (SA). Shorter lifetimes improve security but increase renegotiation frequency.

**Example:**
- **86400 seconds** (24 hours): Common default.
- **3600 seconds** (1 hour): More secure, especially for sensitive environments.

---

## ✅ 3. Configuring an ISAKMP Policy

When configuring a device such as a Cisco router or ASA firewall, you define an ISAKMP policy with the desired parameters.

### 🛠 Example (Cisco IOS):

```bash
crypto isakmp policy 10
 encryption aes 256
 hash sha256
 authentication pre-share
 group 14
 lifetime 86400
```

### 🔍 Explanation:
- `crypto isakmp policy 10`: Creates policy #10 (priority 10).
- `encryption aes 256`: Uses AES-256 for strong encryption.
- `hash sha256`: Ensures data integrity using SHA-256.
- `authentication pre-share`: Devices authenticate using a shared key.
- `group 14`: Utilizes DH Group 14 for secure key exchange.
- `lifetime 86400`: Keys are valid for 24 hours before renegotiation.

---

## ✅ 4. ISAKMP Policy Selection Process

When a VPN connection is initiated, devices compare their ISAKMP policies during IKE Phase 1. The selection process follows this logic:

- **Priority Order**: Policies are evaluated from lowest to highest number (lowest = highest priority).
- **Parameter Matching**: Both peers must match on:
  - Encryption
  - Hashing
  - Authentication
  - Diffie-Hellman Group
  - Lifetime

If no match is found, the negotiation fails and the VPN tunnel cannot be established.

---

## ✅ 5. ISAKMP Policy Best Practices

### 1. **Use Strong Encryption and Hashing**  
Prefer AES-256 and SHA-256 or better to ensure robust confidentiality and integrity.

### 2. **Use Digital Certificates**  
For enhanced scalability and trust, use certificates instead of PSKs.

### 3. **Use Strong DH Groups**  
Use Group 14 or higher to avoid weak key exchanges and resist known cryptographic attacks.

### 4. **Tune Lifetime for Security vs. Performance**  
- **Shorter lifetimes** (e.g., 3600s) offer better security but require more frequent renegotiations.
- **Longer lifetimes** (e.g., 86400s) reduce overhead but slightly increase risk exposure.

---

## 🚀 6. Final Thoughts

An ISAKMP policy is crucial for securely establishing VPN tunnels using IPsec. It controls how two devices authenticate, exchange keys, and agree on cryptographic methods before securing the actual data traffic. Carefully configuring ISAKMP policies with strong, modern parameters is essential to protect data in transit and maintain secure VPN communications.

Let me know if you'd like this formatted into a PDF, turned into flashcards, or broken down further for beginners!Here's an expanded and refined version of your section on **IPsec Policy**, perfect for training materials, study guides, or documentation:

---

## 🔐 19.3. IPsec Policy

### Overview  
An **IPsec policy** defines how data is secured when transmitted over a network using the IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) protocol suite. These policies include parameters for encrypting and authenticating IP packets to ensure **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **authenticity**. IPsec policies are vital in building secure VPN tunnels over untrusted networks, such as the internet.

---

## 🌟 1. What is an IPsec Policy?

An IPsec policy is a comprehensive set of configurations that instructs devices on how to secure traffic between endpoints using IPsec. These policies govern the behavior of **IKE Phase 2** negotiations, which create the actual **IPsec Security Associations (SAs)** used to encrypt and protect data.

Each device participating in the VPN must have a matching IPsec policy to form a successful tunnel. If the policies do not match, the tunnel negotiation will fail.

### Key Elements of an IPsec Policy:
- **Encryption Algorithms**: Define how the data is encrypted.
- **Authentication Algorithms**: Ensure data integrity and verify sender authenticity.
- **Key Exchange Methods**: Securely generate and share encryption keys.
- **Lifetime**: Determines how long keys and SAs remain valid.
- **Security Associations (SAs)**: Define cryptographic parameters for secure data exchange.

---

## ✅ 2. Key Components of IPsec Policy

### 1. 🔒 Encryption Algorithms  
Encryption ensures that transmitted data cannot be read by unauthorized parties. Strong encryption is crucial for maintaining confidentiality.

**Common algorithms:**
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: Modern and secure; AES-256 is widely used.
- **3DES (Triple DES)**: Older algorithm, still supported for legacy systems.
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**: Deprecated due to weak security; should not be used.

---

### 2. 🛡 Authentication Algorithms  
Authentication algorithms protect against tampering and validate the data origin. These are usually cryptographic hash functions or HMACs.

**Common options:**
- **SHA-256**: Strong, widely accepted standard for integrity verification.
- **MD5**: Weak, deprecated; susceptible to collision attacks.
- **HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)**: Combines hashing with a secret key to ensure message authenticity and integrity.

---

### 3. 🔑 Key Exchange Algorithms  
These algorithms are responsible for securely exchanging cryptographic keys between peers.

**Primary methods:**
- **Diffie-Hellman (DH)**: Most commonly used in IPsec. Peers securely compute shared keys over untrusted networks.
  - Common DH Groups: 
    - **Group 2 (1024-bit)**: Basic, outdated.
    - **Group 14 (2048-bit)**: Strong and recommended.
    - **Group 24 (2048-bit elliptic curve)**: Even stronger, ideal for high-security environments.
- **RSA**: Less common for key exchange in IPsec, but still supported in some legacy configurations.

---

### 4. 🔐 Security Associations (SAs)  
A **Security Association** defines the parameters and keys used to protect traffic between two IPsec peers. Each SA includes:
- Encryption and authentication methods.
- Lifetime of the SA.
- Keys and SPI (Security Parameter Index).

SAs are established during:
- **IKE Phase 1**: Builds the ISAKMP SA for control/negotiation traffic.
- **IKE Phase 2**: Builds the IPsec SA for actual data encryption.

---

### 5. ⏱ Lifetime of the IPsec SA  
The **lifetime** determines how long an SA and its keys remain valid before renegotiation is needed. This periodic renewal enhances security.

**Typical values:**
- **3600 seconds (1 hour)**: More secure, reduces window of key compromise.
- **86400 seconds (24 hours)**: Common default, better for performance in low-risk environments.

---

## ✅ 3. IPsec Policy Configuration Example

To configure an IPsec policy, the following elements must be set on a device (e.g., Cisco router):

---

### 🧱 Step 1: Define the Transform Set  
A transform set defines the protocols and algorithms used to secure traffic.

```bash
crypto ipsec transform-set MYTRANSFORMSET esp-aes-256 esp-sha-hmac
```

- `esp-aes-256`: Specifies encryption using AES-256.
- `esp-sha-hmac`: Specifies HMAC-SHA for authentication.

---

### 🔄 Step 2: Define the IPsec Crypto Map  
This maps IPsec policies to specific peers and traffic.

```bash
crypto map MYCRYPTO_MAP 10 ipsec-isakmp
 set peer 192.168.2.1
 set transform-set MYTRANSFORMSET
 match address VPN_ACL
```

- `set peer`: Defines the remote IPsec peer.
- `match address`: Associates an ACL that defines which traffic should be encrypted.

---

### 🔍 Step 3: Define the Access Control List (ACL)  
ACLs identify the traffic to be secured by IPsec.

```bash
access-list 100 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255
```

- Specifies traffic between the local and remote subnets to be encrypted.

---

### 🌐 Step 4: Apply Crypto Map to Interface  
Assign the crypto map to the outbound interface.

```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 crypto map MYCRYPTO_MAP
```

---

## ✅ 4. IPsec Tunnel Modes

IPsec supports two operational modes:

### 1. **Transport Mode**
- Encrypts only the payload (data) of the original IP packet.
- Original IP header remains intact.
- **Use Case**: Host-to-host or client-to-gateway VPNs.

### 2. **Tunnel Mode**
- Encrypts the **entire IP packet**, including header.
- Encapsulates it in a new IP packet with a new header.
- **Use Case**: Site-to-site VPNs between gateways or routers.

> 🚨 **Note:** Tunnel mode is most commonly used in IPsec VPN deployments.

---

## ✅ 5. Troubleshooting IPsec Policy Configuration

If an IPsec tunnel fails to establish, consider the following:

### ✅ Troubleshooting Checklist:
- **ISAKMP Policy Matching**: Ensure both ends agree on encryption, hashing, DH group, and lifetime.
- **Transform Set Compatibility**: Verify both peers use the same transform set parameters.
- **Authentication Method**: Confirm pre-shared keys or certificates are identical and valid.
- **Routing Configuration**: Ensure routes correctly direct traffic through the tunnel.
- **Logs and Debug Commands**: Use tools like `debug crypto isakmp`, `debug crypto ipsec`, and `show crypto session` to identify issues.

---

## 🚀 6. Final Thoughts

An IPsec policy is a critical component of securing communications between remote networks or devices. By defining clear rules for encryption, authentication, and key exchange, IPsec ensures data remains secure across potentially hostile environments like the internet. Proper configuration, regular key renewals, and adherence to modern cryptographic standards are essential to maintaining robust, secure, and reliable VPN connections.

---

## 🔐 19.4. Crypto Map

### 🔎 Overview  
A **Crypto Map** is a crucial configuration element in setting up **IPsec VPN tunnels** on routers and firewalls. It acts as a blueprint that brings together all required components for VPN communication, such as peer IP, encryption/authentication methods, traffic selectors (ACLs), and Security Association (SA) lifetimes.

By applying a crypto map to an interface, the device knows:
- Which traffic to protect.
- How to protect it.
- With whom to establish a secure tunnel.

It enables **site-to-site** or **remote-access VPNs** by defining how IPsec should handle the traffic.

---

## 🌟 1. What is a Crypto Map?

A **Crypto Map** is a set of policies and rules that:
- Defines the **remote peer** (VPN gateway).
- Specifies the **transform set** (encryption/integrity settings).
- Uses an **ACL** to determine which traffic should be encrypted.
- Binds the configuration to a specific **interface** on the device.

Crypto maps must be applied to the physical or logical interface that sends and receives protected traffic, usually an external-facing interface.

---

## ✅ 2. Components of a Crypto Map

Each crypto map entry typically includes the following elements:

### 1. 🔐 **IPsec Transform Set**
Defines the algorithms used for:
- **Encryption** (e.g., AES-256)
- **Integrity/Authentication** (e.g., SHA-256 using HMAC)

> Example: `crypto ipsec transform-set MYTRANSFORMSET esp-aes-256 esp-sha-hmac`

---

### 2. 🌐 **Peer IP Address**
Specifies the IP address of the **remote VPN gateway**. This tells the router who to negotiate the tunnel with.

> Example: `set peer 192.168.2.1`

---

### 3. 📋 **Access Control List (ACL)**
Defines which traffic (based on source/destination IP) should be protected by IPsec.

> Example:
```bash
access-list 100 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255
```
This matches traffic between two internal subnets to be secured.

---

### 4. ⏱ **Security Association (SA) Lifetime**
Defines how long the IPsec SA is valid before renegotiation. This ensures periodic key changes for enhanced security.

> Example: Can be set using `set security-association lifetime seconds 3600`

---

### 5. 🌐 **NAT-T (NAT Traversal)** (Optional)  
If one or both VPN devices are behind a NAT, **NAT Traversal (NAT-T)** allows IPsec to work by encapsulating ESP in UDP packets (usually port 4500).

> Enabled automatically if NAT is detected, or manually with:
```bash
crypto isakmp nat-traversal 20
```

---

### 6. 🔢 **Crypto Map Priority**
The sequence number in a crypto map determines its **priority**. The lowest number has the highest priority and is matched first.

> Example:  
`crypto map MYCRYPTO_MAP 10 ipsec-isakmp`  
→ `10` is the priority.

---

## ✅ 3. Configuring a Crypto Map

### 🧱 Step-by-Step Example (Cisco IOS):

#### 🔹 Step 1: Define the IPsec Transform Set
```bash
crypto ipsec transform-set MYTRANSFORMSET esp-aes-256 esp-sha-hmac
```
- `esp-aes-256`: Encrypts using AES-256
- `esp-sha-hmac`: Authenticates using SHA-256 (HMAC)

---

#### 🔹 Step 2: Define the Crypto Map
```bash
crypto map MYCRYPTO_MAP 10 ipsec-isakmp
 set peer 192.168.2.1
 set transform-set MYTRANSFORMSET
 match address VPN_ACL
```

Explanation:
- **`MYCRYPTO_MAP`**: Name of the crypto map
- **`10`**: Sequence/priority
- **`ipsec-isakmp`**: Specifies IKE (Phase 1) + IPsec (Phase 2)
- **`set peer`**: Defines the remote VPN peer
- **`match address`**: Links to ACL that defines protected traffic

---

#### 🔹 Step 3: Define the ACL
```bash
access-list 100 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255
```
- Matches traffic from local to remote network that should be encrypted.

---

#### 🔹 Step 4: Apply Crypto Map to Interface
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 crypto map MYCRYPTO_MAP
```
- Applies the crypto map to the interface used to reach the remote peer.

---

## ✅ 4. Verification and Monitoring

To ensure the VPN is active and secure:

### 🔍 1. Check Crypto Map Configuration
```bash
show crypto map
```

### 🔍 2. View IPsec Security Associations
```bash
show crypto ipsec sa
```
- Displays tunnel status, packets encrypted/decrypted, and lifetime info.

### 🔍 3. Verify ISAKMP (IKE Phase 1) Status
```bash
show crypto ikev2 sa
```
- Confirms successful Phase 1 negotiation and peer identity.

---

## ✅ 5. Troubleshooting Crypto Map Issues

If the VPN tunnel isn't working:

### 🛠 Common Checks:
- **Encryption/Auth Mismatch**: Both peers must use matching transform sets.
- **ACL Errors**: Ensure the ACL matches **bidirectional** traffic between networks.
- **NAT-T**: Required if either side is behind NAT. Ensure it’s enabled if needed.
- **SA Lifetime**: Mismatched SA lifetimes can prevent tunnel establishment.
- **Use Debugs for Insight**:
  - `debug crypto isakmp`
  - `debug crypto ipsec`

---

## 🚀 6. Final Thoughts

The **Crypto Map** is the core mechanism by which a router or firewall understands how to secure traffic using IPsec. It ties together:
- **Who** to communicate with (peer)
- **How** to protect the traffic (transform set)
- **What** traffic to protect (ACL)
- **Where** to apply protection (interface)

Proper configuration and monitoring of crypto maps is essential for establishing and maintaining secure, stable IPsec VPN connections between sites or remote users.

## 🔐 19.5. IPsec VPN (Internet Protocol Security Virtual Private Network)

### 🔎 Overview  
An **IPsec VPN** is a Virtual Private Network that uses the **IPsec protocol suite** to create a secure, encrypted tunnel over an untrusted network—most commonly the internet. It ensures the **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **authentication** of data by applying robust encryption and verification techniques to the IP packets exchanged between two endpoints.

IPsec VPNs are widely used for:
- **Site-to-site connectivity** (between offices or data centers)
- **Remote access** for employees working from outside the corporate network

They operate at the **network layer (Layer 3)** of the OSI model, meaning they protect all IP-based applications without requiring any changes to the application layer.

---

## 🌟 1. Overview of IPsec VPN

### 🎯 Purpose  
IPsec VPNs allow devices or networks to communicate securely over a public or untrusted medium (e.g., the internet) by encrypting and authenticating IP packets.

### ✅ Key Benefits:
- **Confidentiality**: Encrypts data to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Integrity**: Ensures data has not been modified in transit.
- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of the devices communicating.
- **Scalability**: Easily supports multiple remote sites or users.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Leverages existing internet infrastructure rather than expensive private lines.

---

## ✅ 2. Types of IPsec VPNs

### 🔁 1. **Site-to-Site IPsec VPN**
- **Use Case**: Connects entire networks (e.g., branch office to headquarters).
- **How it works**: VPN gateways (e.g., routers or firewalls) at each site manage encryption/decryption.
- **Traffic Flow**: All internal traffic destined for the remote site is automatically routed through the VPN.

**Example**: A corporate HQ in New York securely connects with a branch office in Berlin via a site-to-site IPsec VPN.

---

### 👤 2. **Remote Access IPsec VPN**
- **Use Case**: Allows individual users to connect to a secure network remotely (e.g., work from home).
- **How it works**: The user runs a VPN client that establishes a secure tunnel to the organization’s VPN gateway.
- **Authentication**: Typically uses pre-shared keys (PSKs) or digital certificates.

**Example**: An employee on a business trip uses a VPN client to securely access internal company systems.

---

## ✅ 3. How IPsec VPN Works

### 🔄 IPsec Operation Phases:

#### 🔹 Phase 1 – **IKE SA Negotiation**
- Establishes a **secure channel** between peers.
- Authenticates the devices using PSK or certificates.
- Performs a **Diffie-Hellman key exchange**.
- Negotiates algorithms (e.g., AES, SHA-256).
- Results in the creation of an **ISAKMP SA** (Security Association).

#### 🔹 Phase 2 – **IPsec SA Negotiation**
- Uses the secure channel from Phase 1 to negotiate an **IPsec SA**.
- Establishes the encryption and authentication methods for data traffic.
- Begins encrypting and authenticating actual user data.

> **Summary**:  
Phase 1 = Control channel setup  
Phase 2 = Secure data channel setup

---

## ✅ 4. IPsec VPN Components

### 🔐 1. **IPsec Tunnel**
An encrypted connection that encapsulates IP packets. In **tunnel mode**, it encrypts the entire original IP packet and adds a new IP header.

---

### 🧩 2. **Security Associations (SAs)**
An SA is a one-way logical connection used to enforce a specific security policy. Each IPsec VPN requires two SAs:  
- One for inbound traffic  
- One for outbound traffic

An SA defines:
- Encryption/authentication algorithms
- Keys and key lifetimes
- IPsec mode (tunnel or transport)

---

### 🔑 3. **IKE (Internet Key Exchange)**
IKE negotiates the parameters and keys used in IPsec tunnels. There are two main versions:
- **IKEv1**: Older, still used in legacy systems.
- **IKEv2**: More secure, efficient, and preferred.

---

### 🌐 4. **NAT Traversal (NAT-T)**
When a device is behind a NAT (common in home and cloud networks), NAT-T encapsulates IPsec traffic in UDP packets to allow traversal through NAT devices.

---

## ✅ 5. IPsec VPN Configuration Example (Cisco IOS)

### 🧱 Step-by-Step

#### 🔹 Step 1: Define IKEv2 Policy
```bash
crypto ikev2 policy 10
 encryption aes-256
 integrity sha256
 group 14
 prf sha256
 lifetime 86400
```
- Strong encryption (AES-256)
- Integrity with SHA-256
- Diffie-Hellman Group 14 (2048-bit)
- Lifetime: 24 hours

---

#### 🔹 Step 2: Define Transform Set (Phase 2)
```bash
crypto ipsec transform-set MYSET esp-aes-256 esp-sha-hmac
```

---

#### 🔹 Step 3: Configure Crypto Map
```bash
crypto map MYMAP 10 ipsec-isakmp
 set peer 192.168.2.1
 set transform-set MYSET
 match address VPN_ACL
```

---

#### 🔹 Step 4: Define ACL (Traffic Selector)
```bash
access-list 100 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255
```

---

#### 🔹 Step 5: Apply Crypto Map to Interface
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 crypto map MYMAP
```

---

# 🔐 19.6. Site-to-Site IPsec VPNs – Summary

A **Site-to-Site IPsec VPN** connects two or more entire networks over an untrusted network like the internet using **Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)**. Unlike Remote Access VPNs, which connect individual users, Site-to-Site VPNs link **VPN gateways** (e.g., routers, firewalls) to allow secure communication between **branch offices**, **remote data centers**, or **partner networks**.

By **authenticating endpoints**, **encrypting traffic**, and ensuring **data integrity**, Site-to-Site VPNs create a secure communication tunnel that mimics a private, dedicated line—**but over a public network**.

---

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step: Implementing a Site-to-Site IPsec VPN

### 🔹 **Phase 1: IKE Authentication and Key Exchange**
- Devices authenticate using:
  - **Pre-shared keys** (simpler, less scalable)
  - **Digital certificates** (preferred in larger environments)
- Negotiate:
  - Encryption algorithms (e.g., **AES-256**)
  - Integrity checks (e.g., **SHA-256**)
  - Key exchange mechanism (e.g., **Diffie-Hellman**)
- Establish a secure IKE SA (Security Association) to protect Phase 2 negotiations

### 🔹 **Phase 2: IPsec Tunnel Establishment**
- Negotiate **IPsec SAs** for actual data encryption
- Use **ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)** to:
  - Encrypt the data
  - Ensure its integrity and authenticity
- Begin **secure transmission** through the tunnel

### 🔹 **Routing Configuration**
- Ensure traffic between sites is routed through the tunnel
- Options:
  - **Static routing** – Simpler but harder to scale
  - **Dynamic routing** (e.g., **OSPF**) – Scales well and adapts to topology changes
- Define routing policies to match encrypted traffic destinations

### 🔹 **Crypto Map Configuration**
- A crypto map includes:
  - **Peer IP address**
  - **Transform set** (encryption/authentication algorithms)
  - **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to match which traffic should be encrypted
- Multiple crypto maps can be defined for different peers

### 🔹 **Apply Crypto Map to Interface**
- Bind the crypto map to the outbound-facing interface (usually the WAN link)
- This ensures that matched traffic is processed by the IPsec engine

---

## 🧩 Key Considerations

### 🔐 Security
- Always use **strong cryptographic standards** (e.g., AES-256, SHA-256)
- Enable **anti-replay protection** and **PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy)** for better resilience

### 🔐 Authentication
- Use **digital certificates** issued by a **trusted CA** for enterprise-grade security
- Pre-shared keys are fine for small-scale or temporary setups

### 📡 Routing
- Ensure that **routing tables** are updated and that VPN traffic doesn’t accidentally leak through the internet
- Consider **split tunneling** or **full tunneling** based on use case

### 🔑 Key Lifetime Management
- Configure **IPsec and IKE lifetimes** to periodically renegotiate keys (e.g., 1 hour for Phase 2)
- Prevents long-lived keys from becoming vulnerable to brute-force or replay attacks
