### 🔧 Suggested Extras You Could Add

1. **Sticky MAC Addressing**:
   - Add this to `port-security` to remember learned MACs:
     ```bash
     switchport port-security mac-address sticky
     ```

2. **Root Guard** (Protects STP Root Role):
   ```bash
   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
   spanning-tree guard root
   ```

3. **VACL Example**:
   ```bash
   vlan access-map BLOCK_HTTP 10
    match ip address 101
    action drop

   vlan filter BLOCK_HTTP vlan-list 10
   ```

4. **802.1X Authentication (RADIUS required)**:
   ```bash
   dot1x system-auth-control
   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    dot1x port-control auto
   ```

---

### 📘 Study Tip
When learning this, simulate it in **Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3**, especially:
- DAI + DHCP Snooping (together for effectiveness)
- Port security violations (`shutdown`, `restrict`, `protect`)
- STP behavior under attack (then applying BPDU Guard)

| **Spoofed/Rogue Devices** | Connect unauthorized hardware                                                | Gaining internal access                                    |

---

## 🛠️ How Attacks Are Performed

1. **Sniffing Traffic** – via flooding or poisoning.
2. **Spoofing Identity** – MAC/IP impersonation.
3. **Protocol Manipulation** – STP, CDP, LLDP abuse.
4. **VLAN Access Bypass** – double-tagging, trunk spoofing.
5. **Denial-of-Service** – DHCP starvation, broadcast storms.

## 🔐 Prevention Techniques

| **Feature**                | **Purpose**                                           |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Port Security              | Limits MACs per port, blocks unknowns                |
| Sticky MAC                 | Learns and binds MACs dynamically                    |
| Dynamic ARP Inspection     | Validates ARP packets against trusted source IP/MAC  |

| 802.1X Authentication      | Requires user/device authentication                  |
| Network Monitoring         | Alerts on suspicious MAC activities                  |

---

## 🧰 Cisco Configuration Snippets

### 🔒 **Port Security + Sticky MAC**
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport port-security
 switchport port-security maximum 2
 switchport port-security mac-address sticky
 switchport port-security violation restrict
```

### 📋 **View Violations**
```bash
show port-security interface GigabitEthernet0/1
```

---

## ✍️ Suggestions for Study & Lab

1. **Lab Simulation Ideas**:
   - Use `macof` in a test lab to overflow a switch (Cisco PT won't simulate this, but GNS3 + real VM will).
   - Simulate MAC Spoofing with `ifconfig` and verify `show mac address-table`.
   - Apply port security and test what happens when you plug in more than 2 devices.

2. **Real-World Tips**:
   - Set **"violation protect"** if you prefer not to alert/block immediately.
   - Consider **Syslog and SNMP traps** for monitoring MAC anomalies.

3. **Memory Trick**:
   - **"Flood – Fake – Fail Open"**: MAC Flooding fills the table with fakes, causing the switch to fail open and flood traffic.

| Double-Tagging           | Embeds two VLAN tags into one packet                         | Bypasses VLAN segmentation                       |
| DHCP Spoofing            | Rogue DHCP server provides malicious VLAN assignments        | Misroutes clients to fake gateways               |
| CDP/LLDP Spoofing        | Sends fake device discovery packets                          | Network mapping or VLAN misdirection             |

---

## 🔧 Cisco Configuration – Best Practices

### ✅ 1. Disable Unused Ports
```bash
interface range GigabitEthernet0/10-24
 shutdown
```

### ✅ 2. Disable Auto-Trunking
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport nonegotiate
```

### ✅ 3. Restrict VLANs on Trunks
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20
```

### ✅ 4. Change Native VLAN (Avoid 1)
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 switchport trunk native vlan 999
```

### ✅ 5. Use VLAN Access Control Lists (VACLs)
```bash
vlan access-map VLAN_SEC 10
 match ip address BLOCK_ATTACKS
 action drop

ip access-list extended BLOCK_ATTACKS
 deny ip any any
```

### ✅ 6. Enable DHCP Snooping
```bash
ip dhcp snooping
ip dhcp snooping vlan 10

interface GigabitEthernet0/3
 ip dhcp snooping trust
```

### ✅ 7. Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection
```bash
ip arp inspection vlan 10

interface GigabitEthernet0/3
 ip arp inspection trust
```

---

## 🧪 Monitoring Tools

| **Command**                        | **Checks For**                                      |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `show interfaces trunk`           | Trunk misconfig or unwanted VLANs                  |
| `show ip dhcp snooping binding`   | Valid MAC-IP bindings and rogue DHCP activity      |
| `show vlan access-map`            | Active VACLs and enforcement                       |

---

## ✅ Best Practices Checklist

- [x] Disable unused ports 🔌  
- [x] Force ports to **access mode**, disable trunk negotiation 🚫  
- [x] Set native VLAN to **unused VLAN ID (e.g. 999)**  
- [x] Use **VACLs** for intra-VLAN traffic control  
- [x] Enable **DHCP Snooping + DAI** for spoofing defense  
- [x] Use **802.1X** to authenticate connecting endpoints  
- [x] Monitor with `show` commands and enable Syslog or SNMP traps  

---

## 💡 Bonus Pro Tip: Use VLAN 1 for Nothing
Never assign user ports, management, or native VLAN to VLAN 1. It’s default, broadcast-prone, and a **prime attack vector**.

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts
**VLAN attacks are sneaky and powerful** when switches are misconfigured or left at defaults. But with intentional hardening like **trunk restrictions, VACLs, DHCP Snooping, and native VLAN reassignment**, you turn your Layer 2 into a fortress.

| **Rogue DHCP Server**   | Malicious DHCP server responds faster than the legitimate one      | Redirects clients to attacker-controlled routes  |
| **DHCP Spoofing**       | Attacker responds with falsified DHCP info (via sniff/intercept)   | Enables MitM and DNS hijacking                   |

---

## 🔧 Mitigation Configuration (Cisco Switches)

### ✅ 1. **Enable DHCP Snooping**
```bash
ip dhcp snooping
ip dhcp snooping vlan 10

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip dhcp snooping trust
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 ip dhcp snooping untrust
```

### ✅ 2. **Limit DHCP Packet Rate**
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/3
 ip dhcp snooping limit rate 10
```

### ✅ 3. **Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)**
```bash
ip arp inspection vlan 10

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip arp inspection trust
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 ip arp inspection untrust
```

### ✅ 4. **Enable Port Security**
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport port-security
 switchport port-security maximum 2
 switchport port-security violation restrict
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Detection

| **Command**                           | **Purpose**                                 |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `show ip dhcp snooping binding`       | Displays legitimate IP-MAC lease bindings   |
| `show ip dhcp snooping statistics`    | Shows DHCP packet counters and violations   |
| `show ip arp inspection statistics`   | Displays DAI activity and violations        |

---

## ✅ Best Practices Checklist

- [x] 🔐 **Enable DHCP Snooping** on all user VLANs
- [x] 📉 **Rate-limit DHCP packets** on access ports
- [x] 🧪 **Use ARP Inspection** to validate IP-MAC bindings
- [x] 🧍‍♂️ **Limit MACs per port** with Port Security
- [x] 🧭 **Segment DHCP servers** into isolated VLANs
- [x] 📊 **Monitor logs and statistics regularly**

---

## 💡 Bonus Tip: Validate DHCP Trust Zones
👉 Only **uplinks to known DHCP servers** should be trusted ports. **All access/user ports = untrusted.**

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

DHCP attacks are often **the first move in an internal breach**—easy to launch, difficult to detect if snooping isn’t enabled. By implementing a layered mitigation approach (Snooping + Rate-Limiting + DAI + Port Security), you create a **robust, self-validating Layer 2 environment** that’s resilient to spoofing and DoS.

## ⚠️ Common ARP Attack Types

| **Attack Type**               | **Description**                                              | **Impact**                                                  |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ARP Spoofing (Poisoning)**  | Sends forged ARP replies associating wrong MACs to IPs       | Redirects traffic to attacker                               |
| **MITM via ARP**              | Attacker impersonates gateway/host to intercept sessions     | Enables credential theft, session hijack                    |
| **ARP-based DoS**             | Floods network with bogus ARP replies                        | Overloads ARP tables, disrupts traffic                      |

---

## 🔧 Cisco Mitigation Configuration

### ✅ 1. **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)**
```bash
ip arp inspection vlan 10

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip arp inspection trust
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 ip arp inspection untrust
```

> DAI requires **DHCP Snooping** to build its trust table!

---

### ✅ 2. **Enable DHCP Snooping**
```bash
ip dhcp snooping
ip dhcp snooping vlan 10

interface GigabitEthernet0/3
 ip dhcp snooping trust
```

---

### ✅ 3. **Use Static ARP Entries (for routers, DNS, etc.)**
```bash
arp 192.168.1.1 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E ARPA
```

---

### ✅ 4. **Limit Devices with Port Security**
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport port-security
 switchport port-security maximum 2
 switchport port-security violation restrict
```

---

### ✅ 5. **Monitor ARP & DHCP Logs**
```bash
show ip arp inspection statistics
show ip dhcp snooping binding
show arp
```

---

## ✅ Best Practices Checklist

- [x] 🔐 **Enable DAI** to validate ARP replies per VLAN
- [x] 📌 **Use DHCP Snooping** as a foundation for ARP filtering
- [x] 🧍‍♂️ **Use Static ARP** for infrastructure like gateways/DNS
- [x] 🚫 **Limit MAC addresses per port** to stop spoofing/flooding
- [x] 📊 **Actively monitor logs** for spikes in ARP activity

---

## 💡 Bonus Insight: When to Use Static ARP

Use static ARP for:
- 🔒 **Routers, firewalls, core switches**
- 🛜 **DHCP or DNS servers**
- 🔄 **Critical IoT/VoIP gateways**

…but **not for large dynamic subnets**—it’s impractical at scale.

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

ARP is **old and vulnerable**, but still widely used. Attackers exploit its trust-based nature for **quick, stealthy MITM attacks**. Cisco’s Dynamic ARP Inspection, paired with DHCP Snooping and smart port security, **turns this trust into verified control**.

---

## 🔐 14.8. Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Security – **Study Summary**

### 🌟 Why It Matters

- 🔁 STP prevents **loops** in redundant switch paths.
- 🧠 Attackers can **manipulate STP** to reroute traffic, cause instability, or hijack control.
- 🧍‍♂️ Unauthorized root bridges = **MITM**, disruption, or **DoS** via frequent recalculations.

---

## ⚠️ Common STP-Based Attacks

| **Attack Type**             | **Technique**                                        | **Impact**                                             |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Root Bridge Attack**      | Sends superior BPDUs to take over STP root role      | Reroutes traffic → enables MITM                        |
| **BPDU Flooding**           | Sends many BPDUs to trigger constant STP recalcs     | High CPU, network instability                          |
| **TCN Injection**           | Injects fake Topology Change Notification frames     | MAC table flush → packet flooding, loss of efficiency  |

---

## 🛡️ Cisco STP Defense Configs

### ✅ 1. **BPDU Guard** (Access Ports)
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 spanning-tree bpduguard enable
```
> 💥 **Auto-disables port** if BPDU is received. Use for user-facing (edge) ports.

---

### ✅ 2. **Root Guard** (Trunk/Uplink Ports)
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 spanning-tree guard root
```
> 🚫 Blocks root takeover attempts from unauthorized switches.

---

### ✅ 3. **BPDU Filtering** (Edge or non-STP ports)
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/3
 spanning-tree bpdufilter enable
```
> 🛑 Suppresses sending/receiving BPDUs where STP isn’t needed.

---

### ✅ 4. **Loop Guard** (Trunk/Redundant Links)
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/4
 spanning-tree guard loop
```
> 🧷 Detects **unidirectional link failures** (e.g., one-way fiber break).

---

### ✅ 5. **Set Root Bridge Priority**
```bash
spanning-tree vlan 10 priority 0
```
> 👑 Locks root bridge role to this device for VLAN 10.

---

## 🔍 STP Monitoring Commands

| **Command**                                      | **Purpose**                                     |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `show spanning-tree summary`                    | Overview of all STP protections and topology    |
| `show spanning-tree root`                       | Displays current root bridge per VLAN           |
| `show spanning-tree interface Gi0/1 detail`     | Detailed config for STP on a given interface    |

---

## ✅ Best Practice Checklist

- [x] **Enable BPDU Guard** on **access ports**
- [x] **Use Root Guard** on **uplinks/trunks**
- [x] **Enable BPDU Filtering** on **non-STP/edge links**
- [x] **Enable Loop Guard** on **redundant trunk paths**
- [x] **Manually configure bridge priority** to protect root role
- [x] **Monitor STP state and BPDU changes** regularly

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

> 🔄 **BPDU Guard + PortFast** = Perfect for user ports  
> 🔍 **Loop Guard ≠ BPDU Guard**: Loop Guard detects failure; BPDU Guard **blocks BPDUs** entirely  
> 🎯 Always **define the root bridge** explicitly to avoid accidental root elections

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

**STP was built for stability**, but it wasn’t built for hostile environments. Without security controls like **BPDU Guard, Root Guard, and Loop Guard**, a single malicious or misconfigured device can destabilize your entire Layer 2 domain. These protections let you take **full control over topology management**, block malicious recalculations, and maintain **deterministic, loop-free forwarding**.

---

### ✅ 4. Mitigation Techniques for Common Attacks

#### ⚙️ **MAC Flooding**
- Enable **Port Security** with MAC address limits.
- Use **Sticky MAC** to automatically bind trusted devices.

#### ⚙️ **ARP Spoofing**
- Enable **Dynamic ARP Inspection** (DAI) to validate ARP traffic.
- Use **DHCP Snooping** to build trusted IP-MAC bindings.

#### ⚙️ **VLAN Hopping**
- Disable **unused ports** and place them in an unused VLAN.
- Apply **VACLs** to restrict inter-VLAN access.

#### ⚙️ **STP Manipulation**
- Enable **BPDU Guard** on access ports to block rogue BPDUs.
- Apply **Root Guard** on trunk links to protect STP root roles.
- **Set switch priority** to manually designate the root bridge.

---

### 🧠 General Layer 2 Security Best Practices

- 🔒 **Disable unused ports** and enable **Port Security** everywhere possible.
- 🎯 Implement **802.1X** to authenticate users and devices before granting access.
- 🕵️‍♂️ Regularly **monitor logs** from DHCP Snooping, ARP Inspection, and STP events.
- 📋 Review `show` commands often:
  - `show port-security address`
  - `show ip dhcp snooping binding`
  - `show ip arp inspection statistics`
  - `show spanning-tree root`

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

Layer 2 security is no longer optional—it’s the **first line of defense** in a secure enterprise network. Attackers often exploit weak Layer 2 controls because they’re closer to endpoints and harder to detect without active configuration and monitoring.

> By combining technologies like **Port Security, DHCP Snooping, Dynamic ARP Inspection, 802.1X, and STP protection**, you can create a **resilient switching environment** that is both **secure and scalable**.

## 🧠 **Layer 2 Threats vs. Cisco Mitigations – Mind Map Structure**

### **1. MAC Table Attacks**
- **Threats**:
  - MAC Flooding
  - MAC Spoofing
  - Port Stealing
- **Mitigations**:
  - Port Security (`switchport port-security`)
  - Sticky MAC (`mac-address sticky`)
  - Monitor Port Violations (`show port-security interface`)

---

### **2. VLAN Attacks**
- **Threats**:
  - VLAN Hopping
  - Double-Tagging
  - CDP/LLDP Spoofing
- **Mitigations**:
  - Disable DTP (`switchport nonegotiate`)
  - Native VLAN hardening (`native vlan 999`)
  - Trunk VLAN filtering (`allowed vlan`)
  - VACLs (VLAN Access Maps)

---

### **3. DHCP Attacks**
- **Threats**:
  - DHCP Starvation
  - Rogue DHCP Server
  - DHCP Spoofing
- **Mitigations**:
  - DHCP Snooping (`ip dhcp snooping`)
  - Rate Limiting (`ip dhcp snooping limit rate`)
  - ARP Inspection (DAI)

---

### **4. ARP Attacks**
- **Threats**:
  - ARP Spoofing
  - MITM via ARP
  - ARP DoS
- **Mitigations**:
  - Dynamic ARP Inspection (`ip arp inspection vlan`)
  - DHCP Snooping (as dependency)
  - Static ARP (for critical devices)
  - Port Security

---

### **5. Address Spoofing**
- **Threats**:
  - MAC Spoofing
  - IP Spoofing
  - DNS Spoofing
- **Mitigations**:
  - DHCP Snooping + ARP Inspection
  - IP Source Guard (`ip verify source`)
  - Port Security
  - uRPF (`ip verify unicast source reachable-via rx`)
  - VACLs (filter spoofed traffic)

---

### **6. STP Attacks**
- **Threats**:
  - Root Bridge Hijacking
  - BPDU Flooding
  - TCN Injection
- **Mitigations**:
  - BPDU Guard (`spanning-tree bpduguard enable`)
  - Root Guard (`spanning-tree guard root`)
  - BPDU Filtering (`spanning-tree bpdufilter enable`)
  - Loop Guard (`spanning-tree guard loop`)
  - Manual Root Bridge Priority (`spanning-tree vlan X priority 0`)
