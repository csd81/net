# 🔥 11.3. IPS on Cisco ISRs (Integrated Services Routers)

**Cisco Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)** offer built-in IPS capabilities, combining **routing, firewalling, and intrusion prevention** into a single device. This integration delivers robust security directly at the network perimeter.

---

## 🌟 1. Why Use IPS on Cisco ISRs?

✅ **Real-Time Threat Prevention** – Blocks malware, DoS, and unauthorized access.  
✅ **Integrated Security** – Eliminates need for separate IPS appliances.  
✅ **Network-Wide Protection** – Defends at the **network edge**.  
✅ **Reduced Latency** – Direct inspection on the router improves performance.  
✅ **Cost-Effective** – Enterprise-grade protection without extra hardware.

## 🔑 2. How IPS Works on Cisco ISRs

### 🔹 Core Functions:

✔ **Inspects** incoming/outgoing traffic in real time  
✔ Uses **signature-based** and **anomaly detection**  
✔ **Blocks or alerts** on malicious patterns  
✔ **Logs and reports** incidents for analysis

### ✅ Network Placement Example:
```
   Internet
      │
[ISP Router]
      │
[ISR with IPS] <--- Analyzes traffic, blocks threats
      │
[Internal Network]
```
🔹 *Traffic is filtered before reaching internal resources.*

---

## 🛠️ 3. Configuring IPS on a Cisco ISR

### ✅ Step 1: Enable IPS on the Router
```plaintext
ip ips name MY_IPS_RULES
ip ips signature-category
 category all
 retired false
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip ips MY_IPS_RULES in
```
🔹 *Applies IPS rules to incoming interface traffic.*

---

### ✅ Step 2: Enable Signature-Based Detection
```plaintext
ip ips signature-definition
 category all
 retired false
```
🔹 *Activates Cisco’s built-in attack signature database.*

---

### ✅ Step 3: Automatically Block Attackers
```plaintext
ip ips name BLOCK_ATTACKS
 event-action deny-attacker-inline
```
🔹 *Blocks traffic from sources exhibiting malicious behavior.*

---

### ✅ Step 4: Configure Logging for Forensics
```plaintext
logging buffered 100000
logging trap notifications
logging console informational
logging monitor debugging
```
🔹 *Captures and stores security event logs for monitoring.*

---

## 🔍 4. Verifying IPS Operation

### ✅ Check IPS Statistics
```plaintext
show ip ips statistics
```
🔹 *Displays blocked attacks, packets inspected, alerts triggered.*

### ✅ Monitor Logs for IPS Alerts
```plaintext
show logging | include IPS
```

### ✅ Test IPS with Simulated Attack
📌 **Example: SSH Port Scan Test**
```bash
nmap -sS -p 22 192.168.1.1
```
🔹 *ISR should detect and block unauthorized SSH scan.*

---

## ✅ 5. Best Practices for IPS on Cisco ISRs

✔ **Deploy at the perimeter** – Stops threats at the network edge  
✔ Use **stateful inspection** – Focuses processing on suspicious flows  
✔ **Regularly update signatures** – Defends against evolving threats  
✔ **Tune detection rules** – Avoid false positives/disruptions  
✔ **Integrate with SIEM** – Enables centralized alerting and analysis

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

**IPS on Cisco ISRs** provides **powerful threat prevention** without requiring extra hardware. With capabilities like real-time inspection, automatic blocking, and flexible logging, ISRs become a **critical line of defense** for modern enterprise networks.
