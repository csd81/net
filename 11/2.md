# 🔥 11.2. IPS Implementations

**Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)** actively detect, analyze, and block cyber threats in real time. Effective IPS implementation is essential for safeguarding networks from malicious activity before damage occurs.

## 🌟 1. Types of IPS Implementations

| IPS Type               | Description                                             | Example Use Case                                      |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Network-Based IPS (NIPS)** | Monitors traffic across the entire network                 | Positioned at the network perimeter to filter threats  |
| **Host-Based IPS (HIPS)**   | Installed on individual devices for localized protection     | Secures critical servers and endpoints                 |
| **Cloud-Based IPS**         | Designed for cloud-native environments                      | Protects workloads in AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud      |
| **Next-Gen IPS (NGIPS)**    | Leverages AI, ML, and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)           | Used in enterprise networks for advanced threat defense |

🔹 *Most enterprises use a **hybrid approach** for layered security.*

## 🔑 2. Placement of IPS in a Network

| Deployment Mode       | Placement Description                          | Purpose                                |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Inline Mode (Active)**     | IPS is placed directly in the path of traffic     | Blocks malicious traffic in real time |
| **Promiscuous Mode (Passive)** | IPS receives a copy of traffic via SPAN/mirror port | Detects threats without blocking      |

### ✅ Example Network Layout – Inline IPS
```
   Internet
      │
[Firewall] ─── [IPS] ─── [Internal Network]
```
🔹 *Inline mode enables **active threat prevention**. Promiscuous mode is **monitor-only**.*

---

## 🛠️ 3. Configuring IPS on Cisco Devices

### ✅ Step 1: Enable IPS on an Interface
```plaintext
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip ips name SECURE_NET in
```
🔹 *Applies IPS rules to incoming traffic.*

---

### ✅ Step 2: Define IPS Rules for Attack Prevention  
📌 **Example: Block Unauthorized SSH Access**
```plaintext
ip ips name BLOCK_SSH
 event-action deny-attacker-inline
!
ip ips signature-category
 category all
 retired false
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip ips BLOCK_SSH in
```
🔹 *Automatically blocks SSH brute-force attempts.*

---

### ✅ Step 3: Log Suspicious or Denied Traffic  
📌 **Example: Log All Denied Packets**
```plaintext
access-list 150 deny ip any any log
ip ips audit-configuration
ip ips apply access-list 150
```
🔹 *Logs all denied traffic for review and analysis.*

---

## 🔍 4. Verifying IPS Functionality

### ✅ Check Signature Status
```plaintext
show ip ips signatures
```

### ✅ Monitor Alerts in Logs
```plaintext
show logging | include IPS
```

### ✅ Test IPS with Simulated Attack  
📌 Example: Simulate SSH Scan
```bash
nmap -sS -p 22 192.168.1.1
```
🔹 *IPS should detect and block unauthorized scans.*

---

## ✅ 5. Best Practices for IPS Implementation

✔ Deploy IPS at **critical points** – perimeter, DMZ, core network  
✔ Use **inline mode** for real-time blocking  
✔ Keep **signature databases updated**  
✔ **Fine-tune rules** to minimize false positives  
✔ Integrate with **SIEM solutions** for alert correlation and forensics

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

An effectively implemented **IPS** is essential for proactive defense against modern threats. From **blocking unauthorized access** to **stopping malware and exploits**, IPS protects the network before damage occurs. When combined with **firewalls**, **HIDS**, and **SIEM**, it forms a robust, layered cybersecurity strategy.
