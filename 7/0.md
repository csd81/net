## üîí 07.0. Module 07: Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) ‚Äî Introduction

**AAA** is a foundational security framework used to manage and secure access to network devices and services. It ensures that only authorized users are allowed in, controls what they can do, and logs everything for accountability and auditing.

---

### üåü 1. Why AAA Matters

- **Improved Security**: Prevents unauthorized access to network devices and services.
- **Granular Access Control**: Applies user role-based privileges.
- **Accountability**: Logs user actions for auditing and troubleshooting.
- **Centralized Management**: Streamlines user management across multiple devices.
- **Compliance**: Helps meet regulatory and policy-driven security requirements.

### üîë 2. Key Components of AAA

| **Component**   | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Authentication** | Verifies user identity (e.g., username and password). <br>üîπ Methods: Local database, RADIUS, TACACS+ |
| **Authorization**  | Determines what authenticated users can do. <br>üîπ Controls command access, interface usage, etc. |
| **Accounting**     | Logs user actions such as logins, commands, and session time. <br>üîπ Useful for audits and tracking resource usage. |

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. AAA Operation Workflow

1. **User Login**: User submits credentials (username/password).
2. **Authentication**: AAA verifies credentials locally or with a server.
3. **Authorization**: Permissions are applied based on user profile.
4. **Accounting**: Activity is logged for auditing.

### üõ†Ô∏è 4. AAA Configuration Overview

| **Step**               | **Action**                                           |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Enable AAA**         | Activate AAA services with `aaa new-model`.          |
| **Configure Authentication** | Define login methods (local or via RADIUS/TACACS+). |
| **Set Up Authorization**     | Assign privilege levels and define access rules.     |
| **Enable Accounting**        | Log user login/logout and command usage.             |

### üì° 5. AAA Server Options

| **Deployment** | **Description** |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Local AAA**  | Authentication is handled by the network device itself. Best for small networks. |
| **Remote AAA** | Uses centralized servers (RADIUS or TACACS+) for scalability and consistency. Ideal for large networks. |

| **Feature**             | **RADIUS**                                      | **TACACS+**                                      |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Auth & Authz**        | Combined                                         | Separate                                          |
| **Encryption**          | Passwords only                                   | Entire communication                              |
| **Port**                | UDP 1812 (Auth), 1813 (Acct)                     | TCP 49                                            |
| **Vendor Support**      | Open Standard                                    | Cisco-Specific                                    |

### üîí 6. Best Practices for AAA Implementation

- **Enable Strong Authentication**: Use complex passwords and enable MFA where possible.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assign users to privilege levels that match their job functions.
- **Restrict Access**: Use ACLs to limit who can reach your AAA servers.
- **Enable Logging**: Use accounting to record login events and commands.
- **Implement Redundancy**: Always configure a backup AAA server for high availability.

### üìä 7. Benefits of AAA Implementation

| **Benefit**              | **Description**                                              |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Enhanced Security**     | Prevents unauthorized access to network infrastructure.     |
| **Granular Access Control** | Provides fine-grained control over what users can access.    |
| **Improved Accountability** | Helps trace user actions for security and troubleshooting.   |
| **Centralized Management**  | Makes managing access easier and more scalable.             |
| **Regulatory Compliance**   | Supports industry standards and legal requirements.         |
