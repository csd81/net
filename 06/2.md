### 🔒 **06.2. Lock Down a Router Using AutoSecure**

**Cisco AutoSecure** is a powerful command-line tool that streamlines the process of securing a router by applying a collection of recommended best practices. It addresses multiple layers of network security, including management access, control plane defense, and service hardening.

---

### 🌟 **1. Why Use AutoSecure?**

- **🔧 Simplified Configuration**  
  Automates security setup—no need to manually apply dozens of commands.

- **⏱️ Time-Saving**  
  Quickly locks down your router in just a few steps, ideal for rapid deployments.

- **🛡️ Improved Security**  
  Applies Cisco security best practices by default (disabling insecure services, enabling secure access, logging, etc.).

- **⚙️ Customizable**  
  Provides an interactive mode so you can fine-tune configurations based on your needs.

### 🔑 **2. Key Features of AutoSecure**

#### 🔐 **Management Plane Protection**
- Enables **SSH** and disables **Telnet** for secure remote management.
- Forces strong password creation and enables **password encryption**.
- Limits management access via **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**.

#### 📡 **Control Plane Protection**
- Disables risky features like **source routing** and **ICMP redirects**.
- Enables **logging** and **alerts** for suspicious control traffic.

#### 📶 **Data Plane Protection**
- Filters user traffic with **ACLs** to block unnecessary services or untrusted sources.
- Limits unnecessary traffic to and from the router.

#### ⚙️ **Service Hardening**
- Disables unneeded services such as:
  - HTTP/HTTPS server
  - SNMP (if not used)
  - Finger and PAD services
- Configures **Syslog** for auditing and alerting.

### 🛠️ **3. Configuration Steps for AutoSecure**

#### 🔹 3.1. Start AutoSecure
```bash
Router# auto secure
```
- Initiates the interactive AutoSecure wizard.

#### 🔹 3.2. Answer the Interactive Prompts
AutoSecure walks you through a set of questions. Recommended answers:

- Enable SSH and disable Telnet? → ✅ Yes  
- Configure login banners and passwords? → ✅ Yes  
- Disable ICMP redirects and source routing? → ✅ Yes  
- Enable logging and alerts? → ✅ Yes  
- Configure ACLs for traffic filtering? → ✅ Yes  
- Disable services like HTTP, SNMP, Finger? → ✅ Yes

#### 🔹 3.3. Verify the Configuration
After AutoSecure runs:
```bash
show ip ssh
show access-lists
show running-config | include secure
show logging
```

### 🔍 **4. Sample AutoSecure Configuration Output**
```plaintext
service password-encryption
ip ssh version 2
!
no ip finger
no service pad
no ip http server
no ip bootp server
!
logging buffered 10000
login on-failure log
!
ip access-list extended SECURE-ACL
 permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any established
 deny ip any any log
```
Explanation:
- SSH is enforced, insecure services are disabled.
- Logging is enabled for audit trails.
- ACLs protect the data plane.

### 📊 **5. Verification and Monitoring**
- **SSH Check:** `show ip ssh`
- **ACL Check:** `show access-lists`
- **Log Monitoring:** `show logging`

### ✅ **6. Key Commands Summary**

| Task                          | Command Example                       |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Start AutoSecure              | `auto secure`                          |
| Check SSH Status              | `show ip ssh`                          |
| View ACLs                     | `show access-lists`                    |
| View Secure Configs           | `show running-config | include secure` |
| Monitor Logs                  | `show logging`                         |

### 🔐 **7. Best Practices When Using AutoSecure**

- **📦 Backup First:**  
  Always back up the current config before starting.  
  `copy running-config startup-config`

- **🧾 Review Changes:**  
  After AutoSecure completes, go through the config to ensure it aligns with your policies.

- **📌 Customize ACLs:**  
  Modify the default ACLs to match your specific topology.

- **🧪 Audit Regularly:**  
  Periodically review the config and logs to maintain your security posture.

### ⚔️ **8. Troubleshooting Tips**

| Issue                  | Possible Cause                           | Solution                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| SSH Not Working        | Missing RSA keys or blocked by ACL       | Generate RSA keys, update ACL rules            |
| Services Blocked       | AutoSecure disabled a needed service      | Manually re-enable required services           |
| Can't Connect Remotely | ACL is too restrictive                    | Adjust ACL to allow your management IP         |
| Logs Missing           | Syslog server not configured or reachable | Verify `logging host` and server availability  |
