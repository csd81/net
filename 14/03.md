## 🛡️ 14.3. Mitigating MAC Table Attacks – **Recap & Enhancement**

### 🔥 Why It Matters
- **Stops MAC flooding** and switch flooding behavior.
- **Protects from sniffing/eavesdropping**.
- **Prevents unauthorized devices** from connecting.
- **Keeps switching infrastructure stable and secure**.

## 🔑 Key Security Features

| **Feature**              | **Purpose**                                                    |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Port Security**        | Limits number of MACs per port – prevents flooding            |
| **Sticky MAC**           | Learns and locks MACs to ports – prevents spoofing            |
| **DAI (ARP Inspection)** | Validates ARP packets – stops ARP spoofing                    |
| **DHCP Snooping**        | Blocks rogue DHCP servers – verifies MAC/IP integrity         |
| **BPDU Guard**           | Prevents rogue STP topologies – blocks BPDUs from hosts       |
| **Storm Control**        | Limits broadcast/multicast floods – prevents DoS              |

## 📊 Monitoring Tools

| **Command**                                | **Purpose**                                       |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `show port-security interface [int]`       | Check for MAC violations                         |
| `show ip arp inspection statistics`        | Detect spoofing attempts                         |
| `show ip dhcp snooping binding`            | View valid MAC/IP bindings                       |

## ✅ Best Practices at a Glance

- 🔐 **Enable Port Security**: Limit MACs and prevent flood attacks.
- 📌 **Use Sticky MACs**: Auto-bind known MACs per port.
- 🧪 **Deploy DAI**: Catch and drop fake ARP replies.
- 🚫 **DHCP Snooping**: Block rogue DHCP and build trust table.
- 🧍‍♂️ **Use 802.1X**: Only allow authenticated users/devices.
- 🧩 **Log and Monitor**: Continuously watch for anomalies.

## 🧠 Pro Tip

> **"Port security without monitoring is like a lock without a door."**  
> Always **pair configuration with logging/alerts** to catch evolving threats.

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

Securing MAC tables is **non-negotiable** in modern switched networks. Attackers love Layer 2 weaknesses because they’re **quiet, internal, and often unmonitored**. Combining **technical features (Port Security, DAI, DHCP Snooping)** with **operational discipline (monitoring, authentication)** keeps your infrastructure resilient and safe.
