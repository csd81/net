This is another excellent and detailed section! You're covering MAC Table Attacks thoroughly‚Äîfrom concepts to CLI configuration. Here‚Äôs a quick enhancement and study-friendly **recap**, along with **extra suggestions** to really lock this knowledge in:

## üß† Quick Summary ‚Äì MAC Table Attacks (Layer 2)

### üö® Why They‚Äôre Dangerous
- Force switches into **flooding mode** (like a hub).
- Enable **eavesdropping**, **DoS**, **bypassed access controls**.
- Often used as part of **multi-stage attacks** (VLAN hopping, MitM, etc).

## üí£ Attack Types Recap

| **Attack Type**      | **Description**                                                       | **Impact**                                         |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **MAC Flooding**     | Bombards switch with fake MACs                                        | Causes flooding ‚Üí enables packet sniffing         |
| **MAC Spoofing**     | Changes attacker‚Äôs MAC to impersonate trusted device                  | Bypasses access control, allows session hijacking |
| **Port Stealing**    | Sends ARP replies to hijack a MAC address                             | Redirects traffic to attacker                     |

## üõ†Ô∏è How They Work ‚Äì Tools & Examples

### ‚úÖ **MAC Flooding**
- Tool: `macof`  
- Command: `macof -i eth0`

### ‚úÖ **MAC Spoofing**
- Command: `ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55`

### ‚úÖ **Port Stealing / ARP Poisoning**
- Tool: `ettercap`  
- Command: `ettercap -Tq -M arp:remote /victim/ /gateway/`

## üîê Prevention Techniques

| **Feature**                | **Purpose**                                           |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Port Security              | Limits MACs per port, blocks unknowns                |
| Sticky MAC                 | Learns and binds MACs dynamically                    |
| Dynamic ARP Inspection     | Validates ARP packets against trusted source IP/MAC  |
| DHCP Snooping              | Builds MAC-IP trust table + blocks rogue DHCP        |
| 802.1X Authentication      | Requires user/device authentication                  |
| Network Monitoring         | Alerts on suspicious MAC activities                  |

## üß∞ Cisco Configuration Snippets

### üîí **Port Security + Sticky MAC**
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport port-security
 switchport port-security maximum 2
 switchport port-security mac-address sticky
 switchport port-security violation restrict
```

### üìã **View Violations**
```bash
show port-security interface GigabitEthernet0/1
```

## ‚úçÔ∏è Suggestions for Study & Lab

1. **Lab Simulation Ideas**:
   - Use `macof` in a test lab to overflow a switch (Cisco PT won't simulate this, but GNS3 + real VM will).
   - Simulate MAC Spoofing with `ifconfig` and verify `show mac address-table`.
   - Apply port security and test what happens when you plug in more than 2 devices.

2. **Real-World Tips**:
   - Set **"violation protect"** if you prefer not to alert/block immediately.
   - Consider **Syslog and SNMP traps** for monitoring MAC anomalies.

3. **Memory Trick**:
   - **"Flood ‚Äì Fake ‚Äì Fail Open"**: MAC Flooding fills the table with fakes, causing the switch to fail open and flood traffic.
