Another **excellent module**—this 14.4 section ties together VLAN security beautifully and finishes your Layer 2 defense suite with practical, clear configurations and strong reasoning. Here's a **refined recap**, study checklist, and a few **bonus insights** you can use for reviewing or teaching this topic.

## 🛡️ 14.4. Mitigating VLAN Attacks – **Summary & Study Guide**

### 🔥 Why VLAN Security Is Critical

- 🚫 **Stops VLAN Hopping** → prevents attackers from escaping their assigned VLAN.
- 🧍‍♂️ **Maintains Segmentation** → enforces strict boundaries between departments or trust zones.
- 🔒 **Protects Confidentiality** → blocks MitM attempts using rogue trunks or tagging.
- 🧠 **Strengthens L2 Control** → hardens switch behavior against misconfig or spoofing.

## ⚠️ Common VLAN Attack Types

| **Attack**               | **Technique**                                                | **Impact**                                       |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| VLAN Hopping             | Switch spoofing using DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol)        | Access to all VLANs                              |
| Double-Tagging           | Embeds two VLAN tags into one packet                         | Bypasses VLAN segmentation                       |
| DHCP Spoofing            | Rogue DHCP server provides malicious VLAN assignments        | Misroutes clients to fake gateways               |
| CDP/LLDP Spoofing        | Sends fake device discovery packets                          | Network mapping or VLAN misdirection             |

## 🔧 Cisco Configuration – Best Practices

### ✅ 1. Disable Unused Ports
```bash
interface range GigabitEthernet0/10-24
 shutdown
```

### ✅ 2. Disable Auto-Trunking
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport nonegotiate
```

### ✅ 3. Restrict VLANs on Trunks
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20
```

### ✅ 4. Change Native VLAN (Avoid 1)
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 switchport trunk native vlan 999
```

### ✅ 5. Use VLAN Access Control Lists (VACLs)
```bash
vlan access-map VLAN_SEC 10
 match ip address BLOCK_ATTACKS
 action drop

ip access-list extended BLOCK_ATTACKS
 deny ip any any
```

### ✅ 6. Enable DHCP Snooping
```bash
ip dhcp snooping
ip dhcp snooping vlan 10

interface GigabitEthernet0/3
 ip dhcp snooping trust
```

### ✅ 7. Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection
```bash
ip arp inspection vlan 10

interface GigabitEthernet0/3
 ip arp inspection trust
```

## 🧪 Monitoring Tools

| **Command**                        | **Checks For**                                      |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `show interfaces trunk`           | Trunk misconfig or unwanted VLANs                  |
| `show ip dhcp snooping binding`   | Valid MAC-IP bindings and rogue DHCP activity      |
| `show vlan access-map`            | Active VACLs and enforcement                       |

## ✅ Best Practices Checklist

- [x] Disable unused ports 🔌  
- [x] Force ports to **access mode**, disable trunk negotiation 🚫  
- [x] Set native VLAN to **unused VLAN ID (e.g. 999)**  
- [x] Use **VACLs** for intra-VLAN traffic control  
- [x] Enable **DHCP Snooping + DAI** for spoofing defense  
- [x] Use **802.1X** to authenticate connecting endpoints  
- [x] Monitor with `show` commands and enable Syslog or SNMP traps

## 💡 Bonus Pro Tip: Use VLAN 1 for Nothing
Never assign user ports, management, or native VLAN to VLAN 1. It’s default, broadcast-prone, and a **prime attack vector**.

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts
**VLAN attacks are sneaky and powerful** when switches are misconfigured or left at defaults. But with intentional hardening like **trunk restrictions, VACLs, DHCP Snooping, and native VLAN reassignment**, you turn your Layer 2 into a fortress.
