## 🔐 14.6. Mitigating ARP Attacks – **Recap & Study Guide**

### 🌟 Why ARP Mitigation Is Critical

- 🧍‍♂️ **Stops MITM Attacks** – Protects traffic integrity between hosts.
- 🔐 **Secures Credentials** – Shields sensitive data from theft or manipulation.
- 🚫 **Prevents DoS** – Avoids ARP table flooding, which can slow or break networks.
- 🧠 **Reinforces Layer 2 Trust** – ARP spoofing is easy to launch, but dangerous to ignore.

## ⚠️ Common ARP Attack Types

| **Attack Type**               | **Description**                                              | **Impact**                                                  |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ARP Spoofing (Poisoning)**  | Sends forged ARP replies associating wrong MACs to IPs       | Redirects traffic to attacker                               |
| **MITM via ARP**              | Attacker impersonates gateway/host to intercept sessions     | Enables credential theft, session hijack                    |
| **ARP-based DoS**             | Floods network with bogus ARP replies                        | Overloads ARP tables, disrupts traffic                      |

## 🔧 Cisco Mitigation Configuration

### ✅ 1. **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)**
```bash
ip arp inspection vlan 10

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip arp inspection trust
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 ip arp inspection untrust
```

> DAI requires **DHCP Snooping** to build its trust table!

---

### ✅ 2. **Enable DHCP Snooping**
```bash
ip dhcp snooping
ip dhcp snooping vlan 10

interface GigabitEthernet0/3
 ip dhcp snooping trust
```

---

### ✅ 3. **Use Static ARP Entries (for routers, DNS, etc.)**
```bash
arp 192.168.1.1 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E ARPA
```

---

### ✅ 4. **Limit Devices with Port Security**
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport port-security
 switchport port-security maximum 2
 switchport port-security violation restrict
```

---

### ✅ 5. **Monitor ARP & DHCP Logs**
```bash
show ip arp inspection statistics
show ip dhcp snooping binding
show arp
```

---

## ✅ Best Practices Checklist

- [x] 🔐 **Enable DAI** to validate ARP replies per VLAN
- [x] 📌 **Use DHCP Snooping** as a foundation for ARP filtering
- [x] 🧍‍♂️ **Use Static ARP** for infrastructure like gateways/DNS
- [x] 🚫 **Limit MAC addresses per port** to stop spoofing/flooding
- [x] 📊 **Actively monitor logs** for spikes in ARP activity

---

## 💡 Bonus Insight: When to Use Static ARP

Use static ARP for:
- 🔒 **Routers, firewalls, core switches**
- 🛜 **DHCP or DNS servers**
- 🔄 **Critical IoT/VoIP gateways**

…but **not for large dynamic subnets**—it’s impractical at scale.

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

ARP is **old and vulnerable**, but still widely used. Attackers exploit its trust-based nature for **quick, stealthy MITM attacks**. Cisco’s Dynamic ARP Inspection, paired with DHCP Snooping and smart port security, **turns this trust into verified control**.
