This is a **solid summary of Layer 2 Security**‚Äîvery clear and well-structured! If you're studying for a certification like **CCNA** or just working on hardening your network, this covers the essentials. Here's a quick breakdown and a few suggestions to enhance your notes:

### ‚úÖ **Quick Highlights Recap**

#### üîí Why Layer 2 Security Matters:
- Prevents internal attacks like **MAC flooding**, **VLAN hopping**, and **spoofing**.
- Enhances network **integrity**, **segmentation**, and **trust** at the switch level.

#### üö® Common Layer 2 Attacks:
- **MAC Flooding** ‚Üí Switch behaves like a hub.
- **ARP Spoofing** ‚Üí Leads to **MitM** attacks.
- **STP Manipulation** ‚Üí Alters network paths.
- **VLAN Hopping** ‚Üí Bypasses isolation.
- **DHCP Starvation** ‚Üí DoS on IP assignment.

#### üõ°Ô∏è Security Tools & Countermeasures:
| Feature                  | Blocks or Mitigates                            |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Port Security            | MAC flooding, unauthorized devices            |
| Dynamic ARP Inspection   | ARP spoofing                                   |
| DHCP Snooping            | Rogue DHCP servers, DHCP starvation           |
| BPDU Guard               | STP attacks                                    |
| Storm Control            | Broadcast/multicast floods                     |
| Private VLANs            | Intra-VLAN communication limits               |

### üîß Suggested Extras You Could Add

1. **Sticky MAC Addressing**:
   - Add this to `port-security` to remember learned MACs:
     ```bash
     switchport port-security mac-address sticky
     ```

2. **Root Guard** (Protects STP Root Role):
   ```bash
   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
   spanning-tree guard root
   ```

3. **VACL Example**:
   ```bash
   vlan access-map BLOCK_HTTP 10
    match ip address 101
    action drop

   vlan filter BLOCK_HTTP vlan-list 10
   ```

4. **802.1X Authentication (RADIUS required)**:
   ```bash
   dot1x system-auth-control
   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    dot1x port-control auto
   ```

### üìò Study Tip
When learning this, simulate it in **Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3**, especially:
- DAI + DHCP Snooping (together for effectiveness)
- Port security violations (`shutdown`, `restrict`, `protect`)
- STP behavior under attack (then applying BPDU Guard)
