
ZPF Overview



10.1.1



Benefits of a ZPF	There are two configuration models for Cisco IOS Firewall:



* Classic Firewall - The traditional configuration model in which firewall policy is applied on interfaces.



* Zone-based Policy Firewall (ZPF) - The configuration model in which interfaces are assigned to security zones, and firewall policy is applied to traffic moving between the zones.



If an additional interface is added to the private zone, the hosts connected to the new interface in the private zone can pass traffic to all hosts on the existing interface in the same zone. A simple three-zone network is shown in the figure.

Internet



The primary motivations for network security professionals to migrate to the ZPF model are structure and ease of use. The structured approach is useful for documentation and communication. The ease of use makes network security implementations more accessible to a larger community of security professionals.



There are several benefits of a ZPF:



It is not dependent on ACLs.

The router security posture is to block unless explicitly allowed.

Policies are easy to read and troubleshoot with the Cisco Common Classification Policy Language (C3PL). C3PL is a structured method to create traffic policies based on events, conditions, and actions. This provides scalability because one policy affects any given traffic, instead of needing multiple ACLs and inspection actions for different types of traffic.

Virtual and physical interfaces can be grouped into zones.

Policies are applied to unidirectional traffic between zones.



When deciding whether to implement IOS Classic Firewall or a ZPF, it is important to note that both configuration models can be enabled concurrently on a router. However, the models cannot be combined on a single interface. For example, an interface cannot be

Classic Firewall	The traditional configuration model in which firewall policy is applied on interfaces.

Zone-based Policy Firewall (ZPF)	The configuration model in which interfaces are assigned to security zones, and firewall policy is applied to traffic moving between the zones.



10.1.2 ZPF Design	



Designing ZPFs involves several steps:



Step 1. Determine the zones - The administrator focuses on the separation of the network into zones. Zones establish the security borders of a network. A zone defines a boundary where traffic is subjected to policy restrictions as it crosses to another region of the network. For example, the public network would be one zone and the internal network would be another zone.



Step 2. Establish policies between zones - For each pair of "source-destination" zones (for example, from the inside network to the outside internet), define the sessions that clients in the source zones can request from servers in destination zones. These sessions are most often TCP and UDP sessions, but may also be ICMP sessions, such as ICMP echo. For traffic that is not based on the concept of sessions, the administrator must define unidirectional traffic flows from source to destination and vice versa. Policies are unidirectional and are defined based on source and destination zones, which are known as zone pairs.



Step 3. Design the physical infrastructure - After the zones have been identified, and the traffic requirements between them documented, the administrator must design the physical infrastructure. The administrator must take into account security and availability requirements when designing the physical infrastructure. This includes dictating the number of devices between most-secure and least-secure zones and determining redundant devices.



Step 4. Identify subsets within zones and merge traffic requirements - For each firewall device in the design, the administrator must identify zone subsets that are connected to its interfaces and merge the traffic requirements for those zones. For example, multiple zones might be indirectly attached to a single interface of a firewall. This would result in a

ZPF Operation



10.2.1 ZPF Actions	



Policies identify actions that the ZPF will perform on network traffic. Three possible actions can be configured to process traffic by protocol, source and destination zones (zone pairs), and other criteria.



Inspect - This performs Cisco IOS stateful packet inspection.

Drop - This is analogous to a deny statement in an ACL. A log option is available to log the rejected packets.

Pass - This is analogous to a permit statement in an ACL. The pass action does not track the state of connections or sessions within the traffic.

Drop	This is analogous to a deny statement in an ACL. A log option is available to log the rejected packets.

Pass	This is analogous to a permit statement in an ACL. The pass action does not track the state of connections or sessions within the traffic.

10.2.2



Rules for Transit Traffic	Traffic transiting through router interfaces is subject to several rules governing interface behavior. For the transit traffic example, refer to the topology shown in the figure.



Basic Security Zone Topology



DMZ ZonePrivate ZoneInternetPublic Zone



The rules depend on whether or not the ingress and egress interfaces are members of the same zone:



If neither interface is a zone member, then the resulting action is to pass the traffic.

If both interfaces are members of the same zone, then the resulting action is to pass the traffic.

If one interface is a zone member, but the other is not, then the resulting action is to drop the traffic regardless of whether a zone-pair exists.

If both interfaces belong to the same zone-pair and a policy exists, then the resulting action is inspect, allow, or drop as defined by the policy.



The table summarizes these rules.

Rules for Traffic to the Self Zone	The self zone is the router itself and includes all of the IP addresses assigned to the router interfaces. This is traffic that originates at the router or is addressed to a router interface. Specifically, the traffic is either for device management, for example SSH, or traffic forwarding control, such as routing protocol traffic. The rules for a ZPF are different for the self zone. For the self zone traffic example, refer to the topology shown in the previous figure.



The rules depend on whether the router is the source or the destination of the traffic, as shown in the table. If the router is the source or the destination, then all traffic is permitted. The only exception is if the source and destination are a zone-pair with a specific service-policy. In that case, the policy is applied to all traffic.

Configure a ZPF



10.3.1



Configure a ZPF	The topology shown in the figure will be used throughout the remainder of this topic to demonstrate ZPF configuration. The sequence of steps is not required. However, some configurations must be completed in order. For instance, you must configure a class-map before you assign a class-map to a policy-map. Similarly, you cannot assign a policy-map to a zone-pair until you have configured the policy. If you try to configure a section that relies on another portion of the configuration that you have not yet configured, the router responds with an error message.



Zone-Based Policy Firewall Configuration Steps



R1G0/0S0/0/0

Private ZoneHTTPHTTP return trafficAny other trafficInternetPublic Zone



Step 1: Create the zones.

Step 2: Identify traffic with a class-map.

Step 3: Define an action with a policy-map.

Step 4: Identify a zone pair and match it to a policy-map.

Step 5: Assign zones to the appropriate interfaces.

10.3.2



Step 1. Create the Zones	The first step, is to create the zones. However, before creating the zones answer a few questions:



What interfaces should be included in the zones?

What will be the name for each zone?

What traffic is necessary between the zones and in which direction?



In the example topology, we have two interfaces, two zones, and traffic flowing in one direction. Traffic sourced from the public zone will not be allowed. Create the private and public zones for the firewall with the zone security command, as shown here.



Router(config)# zone security zone-name





R1(config)# zone security PRIVATE

R1(config-sec-zone)# exit

R1(config)# zone security PUBLIC

R1(config-sec-zone)# exit

R1(config)#

10.3.3



Step 2. Identify Traffic	The second step is to use a class-map to identify the traffic to which a policy will be applied. A class is a way of identifying a set of packets based on its contents using "match" conditions. Typically, you define a class so that you can apply an action to the identified traffic that reflects a policy. A class is defined with class-maps.



The example below shows the syntax for the class-map command. There are several types of class-maps. For a ZPF configuration, use the inspect keyword to define a class-map. Determine how packets are evaluated when multiple match criteria exist. Packets must meet one of the match criteria (match-any) or all of the match criteria (match-all) to be considered a member of the class.



Router(config)# class-map type inspect [match-any | match-all] class-map-name



Parameter

Description



match-any: Packets must meet one of the match criteria to be considered a member of the class.



match-all: Packets must meet all of the match criteria to be considered a member of the class.



class-map-name: Name of the class-map that will be used to configure the policy for the class in the policy-map.



The example below shows the syntax for the match statements in class-map sub-configuration mode. Match traffic to an ACL, a specific protocol, or even another class-map.



Router(config-cmap)# match access-group {acl-# | acl-name }

Router(config-cmap)# match protocol protocol-name

Router(config-cmap)# match class-map class-map-name



Parameter

Description



match access-group: Configures the match criteria for a class-map based on the specified ACL number or name.



match protocol: Configures the match criteria for a class-map based on the specified protocol.



match class-map: Uses another class-map to identify traffic.



In the topology, HTTP traffic is being allowed to cross R1 from the PRIVATE to the PUBLIC z

match-any	Packets must meet one of the match criteria to be considered a member of the class.

match-all	Packets must meet all of the match criteria to be considered a member of the class.

class-map-name	Name of the class-map that will be used to configure the policy for the class in the policy-map.

match access-group	Configures the match criteria for a class-map based on the specified ACL number or name.

match protocol	Configures the match criteria for a class-map based on the specified protocol.

match class-map	Uses another class-map to identify traffic.

10.3.4



Step 3. Define an Action	The third step is to use a policy-map to define what action should be taken for traffic that is a member of a class. The example below shows the command syntax to configure a policy-map. An action is a specific functionality. It is typically associated with a traffic class. For example, inspect, drop, and pass are actions.



R1(config)# policy-map type inspect policy-map-name

R1(config-pmap)# class type inspect class-map-name

R1(config-pmap-c)# {inspect | drop | pass}



Parameter

Description



inspect: An action that offers state−based traffic control. The router maintains session information for TCP and UDP and permits return traffic.



drop: Discards unwanted traffic



pass: A stateless action that allows the router to forward traffic from one zone to another



The example below shows an example of a policy-map configuration. The class HTTP-TRAFFIC that was configured in the previous step is associated with a new policy-map named PRIV-TO-PUB-POLICY. The third inspect command configures R1 to maintain state information for all traffic that is a member of the class HTTP-TRAFFIC.



R1(config)# policy-map type inspect PRIV-TO-PUB-POLICY

R1(config-pmap)# class type inspect HTTP-TRAFFIC

R1(config-pmap-c)# inspect



inspect - This action offers state-based traffic control. For example, if traffic traveling from the PRIVATE zone to the PUBLIC zone is inspected, the router maintains connection or session information for TCP and UDP traffic. The router would then permit return traffic sent from PUBLIC zone hosts in reply to PRIVATE zone connection requests.



drop - This is the default action for all traffic. Similar to the implicit deny any at the end of every ACL, there is an explicit drop applied by the IOS to the end of every policy−map. It is listed as class class-default in the last section of any policy-map configuration. Other

inspect	This action offers state-based traffic control. For example, if traffic traveling from the PRIVATE zone to the PUBLIC zone is inspected, the router maintains connection or session information for TCP and UDP traffic. The router would then permit return traffic sent from PUBLIC zone hosts in reply to PRIVATE zone connection requests.

drop	This is the default action for all traffic. Similar to the implicit deny any at the end of every ACL, there is an explicit drop applied by the IOS to the end of every policy−map. It is listed as class class-default in the last section of any policy-map configuration. Other class−maps within a policy−map can also be configured to drop unwanted traffic. Unlike ACLs, traffic is silently dropped, and no ICMP unreachable messages are sent to the source of the traffic.

pass	This action allows the router to forward traffic from one zone to another. The pass action does not track the state of connections. Pass only allows the traffic in one direction. A corresponding policy must be applied to allow return traffic to pass in the opposite direction. The pass action is ideal for secure protocols with predictable behavior, such as IPsec. However, most application traffic is better handled in the ZPF with the inspect action.

10.3.5



Step 4. Identify a Zone-Pair and Match to a Policy	The fourth step is to identify a zone pair and associate that zone pair to a policy-map. The example below shows the command syntax. Create a zone-pair with the zone-pair security command. Then use the service-policy type inspect command to attach a policy-map and its associated action to the zone-pair.



Router(config)# zone-pair security zone-pair-name source {source-zone-name | self} destination {destination-zone-name | self}

Router(config-sec-zone-pair)# service-policy type inspect policy-map-name



Parameter

Description



source source-zone-name: Specifies the name of the zone from which traffic is originating.



destination destination-zone-name: Specifies the name of the zone to which traffic is destined.



self: Specifies the system-defined zone. Indicates whether traffic will be going to or from the router itself.



The example below shows an example of a zone-pair configuration. A zone-pair named PRIV-PUB is created with PRIVATE assigned as the source zone and PUBLIC assigned as the destination zone. Then the policy-map created in the previous step is associated to the zone-pair.



After the firewall policy has been configured, the administrator applies it to traffic between a pair of zones using the zone-pair security command. To apply a policy, it is assigned to a zone pair. The zone pair needs to specify the source zone, the destination zone, and the policy for handling the traffic between the source and destination zones.



R1(config)# zone-pair security PRIV-PUB source PRIVATE destination PUBLIC

R1(config-sec-zone-pair)# service-policy type inspect PRIV-TO-PUB-POLICY

source source-zone-name	Specifies the name of the zone from which traffic is originating.

destination destination-zone-name	Specifies the name of the zone to which traffic is destined.

self	Specifies the system-defined zone. Indicates whether traffic will be going to or from the router itself.

10.3.6



Step 5. Assign Zones to Interfaces	The fifth step is to assign zones to the appropriate interfaces. Associating a zone to an interface will immediately apply the service-policy that has been associated with the zone. If no service-policy is yet configured for the zone, all transit traffic will be dropped. Use the zone-member security command to assign a zone to an interface, as shown in the example below.



Router(config-if)# zone-member security zone-name



In the following example, GigabitEthernet 0/0 is assigned the PRIVATE zone, and Serial 0/0/0 is assigned the PUBLIC zone.



R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0/0

R1(config-if)# zone-member security PRIVATE

R1(config-if)# interface Serial 0/0/0

R1(config-if)# zone-member security PUBLIC



The service-policy is now active. HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS traffic sourced from the PRIVATE zone and destined for the PUBLIC zone will be inspected. Traffic sourced from the PUBLIC zone and destined for the PRIVATE zone will only be allowed if it is part of sessions originally initiated by PRIVATE zone hosts.

10.3.7



Verify a ZPF Configuration	Verify a ZPF configuration by viewing the running configuration. Notice that the class-map is listed first. Then the policy-map makes use of the class-map. Also, notice the highlighted class class-default that will drop all other traffic that is not a member of the HTTP-TRAFFIC class.



The zone configurations follow the policy-map configurations with zone naming, zone pairing, and associating a service-policy to the zone pair. Finally, the interfaces are assigned zones.

The example below shows verification information after a test of the ZPF configuration. A PRIVATE zone host 192.168.1.3 established an HTTPS session with a web server at 10.1.1.2. Notice further down in the command output that four packets matched the class class-default. This verification information was generated by having host 192.168.1.3 ping the web server at 10.1.1.2.

ZPF Configuration Considerations	When configuring a ZPF with the CLI, there are several factors to consider:



The router never filters the traffic between interfaces in the same zone.

An interface cannot belong to multiple zones. To create a union of security zones, specify a new zone and appropriate policy map and zone pairs.

ZPF can coexist with Classic Firewall although they cannot be used on the same interface. Remove the ip inspect interface configuration command before applying the zone-member security command.

Traffic can never flow between an interface assigned to a zone and an interface without a zone assignment. Applying the zone-member configuration command always results in a temporary interruption of service until the other zone-member is configured.

The default inter-zone policy is to drop all traffic unless otherwise specifically allowed by the service-policy configured for the zone-pair.

The zone-member command does not protect the router itself (traffic to and from the router is not affected) unless the zone- pairs are configured using the predefined self zone.

Zone-Based Firewalls Summary



10.4.1



What Did I Learn in this Module?	ZPF Overview



The IOS ZPF provides a flexible and powerful replacement for the older Classic IOS Firewall. It provides a new configuration mode in which interfaces are assigned to security zones and firewall policies are applied to traffic moving between the zones. The ZPF provides a structured and simplified method of designing and implementing network security on routers that are performing a firewall function.



ZPF Operation



ZPFs use user-defined policies to act on specific traffic that is travelling from a source zone to a destination zone. Three actions can be specified:



Inspect - The ZPF performs stateful packet inspection.

Drop - The traffic is not permitted to travel to the destination. The rejected packets can be logged.

Pass - The traffic is permitted to travel to the destination zone. This does not track the state of connections or sessions.



Default rules are applied to transit traffic based on the configuration of the ingress and egress interfaces and the existence of policies. For example, if neither ingress or egress interface is defined as member of a zone, traffic is permitted to exit the egress interface. Similarly, if both interfaces are members of the same zone, then traffic is allowed to pass. However, if one interface is a member of a zone and the other is not, traffic will be dropped. It is important to understand these and the other rules covered in the module.



A special zone exists that is known as the self zone. The self zone is the router itself. In the self zone, the router interfaces serve as either the source or destination of the traffic. Self zone traffic is either for management of the device, or for traffic forwarding control. Similar to the rules for transit traffic, rules exist for how traffic in the self zone will be handled.



Configure a ZPF



There are five steps in the process

Inspect	The ZPF performs stateful packet inspection.

Drop	The traffic is not permitted to travel to the destination. The rejected packets can be logged.

Pass	The traffic is permitted to travel to the destination zone. This does not track the state of connections or sessions.
