## üîê 21.6. AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting)

### üîé Overview

**AAA**‚ÄîAuthentication, Authorization, and Accounting‚Äîis a critical security framework used in Cisco ASA firewalls to manage and control user access. By implementing AAA, you ensure that:
- Only **verified users** can access the device,
- Their access is **restricted to approved resources**,
- Their activities are **logged and auditable**.

Whether managing local users or integrating with **centralized identity servers** (e.g., **TACACS+** or **RADIUS**), AAA enables **fine-grained control and visibility** into administrative access and network security operations.

---

## üåü 1. What is AAA in ASA?

AAA serves the following functions:

| Component      | Function                                                             |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Authentication** | Verifies who the user is (via username/password, tokens, etc.).        |
| **Authorization**  | Determines what the user can do (e.g., access levels, commands).       |
| **Accounting**     | Tracks what the user did (e.g., login/logout, commands used, durations).|

ASA supports:
- **Local AAA**: Using the internal user database.
- **Remote AAA**: Using TACACS+ or RADIUS servers.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Configuring AAA on ASA

---

### 2.1 üîê Local Authentication (Basic Setup)

Best for **small networks or test labs**.

```bash
username admin password YourPassword privilege 15
aaa authentication ssh console LOCAL
```

- `username admin`: Creates a user with **full access** (`privilege 15`).
- `aaa authentication ssh console LOCAL`: Enables **SSH login** using the **local database**.

> ‚úÖ Tip: Always include a fallback local user when using remote AAA for redundancy.

---

### 2.2 üîó Using a TACACS+ Server

Provides centralized **authentication**, **authorization**, and **accounting**.

```bash
aaa-server TACACS+ protocol tacacs+
aaa-server TACACS+ (inside) host 192.168.1.100 key MySecretKey

aaa authentication ssh console TACACS+ LOCAL
aaa authorization exec default TACACS+ LOCAL
aaa accounting exec default start-stop group TACACS+
```

- **Fallback to LOCAL**: Ensures access if the TACACS+ server is unreachable.
- Common in **enterprise deployments** needing **granular command control**.

---

### 2.3 üîó Using a RADIUS Server

Simpler than TACACS+, commonly used for **authentication**.

```bash
aaa-server RADIUS protocol radius
aaa-server RADIUS (inside) host 192.168.1.200 key RADIUSKey

aaa authentication ssh console RADIUS LOCAL
aaa authorization exec default RADIUS LOCAL
```

- RADIUS typically combines **authentication** and **authorization** in one step.
- Supports **VPN user management**, **802.1X**, etc.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Configuring Privilege Levels

Cisco ASA supports **16 privilege levels (0‚Äì15)**:
- **Level 15**: Full admin access.
- **Level 0‚Äì14**: Limited or custom command access.

```bash
username user1 password User1Password privilege 10
```

> ‚úÖ You can customize which commands are available at each level.

**Privilege Level Examples:**
| Level | Description                    |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| 0     | Very limited (basic commands). |
| 1     | Default user access.           |
| 10    | Mid-level access (custom).     |
| 15    | Full admin access.             |

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Accounting Configuration

Accounting logs **who did what and when**, helping with **auditing**, **compliance**, and **forensics**.

**Example: Configure Exec Session Accounting**
```bash
aaa accounting exec default start-stop group TACACS+
```

- Sends logs to the AAA server when users log in/out of privileged exec mode.

---

### 4.1 üßæ Viewing Accounting Logs

- **Syslog Server**: If configured, accounting messages are sent to external log collectors.
- **AAA Server Console**: TACACS+/RADIUS logs are typically available via GUI or CLI on the server.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Viewing & Troubleshooting AAA

**Useful Commands:**
```bash
show aaa-server
show running-config aaa
debug aaa authentication
```

These commands help troubleshoot **authentication failures**, **server communication**, and **policy application**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Use `debug` with caution in production‚Äîit is resource-intensive.

---

## üöÄ 6. Final Thoughts

AAA on ASA is essential for:
- Enforcing **who can access** the firewall.
- Controlling **what they can do**.
- Logging **all activity** for compliance and visibility.

By combining local configuration for backup and remote integration for scale, AAA enables **secure, auditable, and manageable** firewall access control.
