## 🔐 21.7. Service Policies on an ASA

### 🔎 Overview

**Service Policies** on a Cisco ASA allow administrators to **define how traffic is managed, inspected, and prioritized** as it flows through the firewall. These policies extend beyond basic access control to include:
- **Protocol inspection** for application-layer protection
- **Quality of Service (QoS)** and **traffic shaping**
- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)** for security enforcement

Service policies are configured using **class maps** and **policy maps**, then applied globally or per interface using a **service-policy** command.

---

## 🌟 1. What are Service Policies?

Service Policies determine **how the ASA processes network traffic** by:
- Applying protocol inspection (e.g., HTTP, SMTP, FTP)
- Enabling DPI for advanced security
- Prioritizing traffic (e.g., VoIP over bulk downloads)
- Limiting bandwidth for non-critical applications

They provide **granular control** over both security and performance, and are typically used in conjunction with ACLs and NAT rules.

---

## ✅ 2. Types of Service Policies

---

### 2.1 🔒 Access Control Extension

While **ACLs** control basic traffic flow (permit/deny), service policies enhance this by **inspecting** and **managing behavior** of allowed traffic, particularly at **application and protocol levels**.

---

### 2.2 ⚙️ Traffic Shaping & QoS

Used to **limit bandwidth** or **prioritize specific traffic types** like voice, video, or business-critical apps.

**Example: Basic Traffic Policing**
```bash
policy-map global_policy
 class class-default
  police input 1000000 500000 20000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop
service-policy global_policy global
```

- Limits traffic to 1 Mbps, with burst handling.
- Ensures **traffic smoothing** and **congestion protection**.

---

### 2.3 🔍 Protocol Inspection

ASA can inspect various protocols for **anomalies or threats**.

**Example: Enabling HTTP Inspection**
```bash
policy-map global_policy
 class inspection_default
  inspect http
service-policy global_policy global
```

- Ensures ASA monitors **HTTP traffic** for known attacks (e.g., XSS, injections).

---

### 2.4 🧠 Application Layer Inspection (DPI)

Performs **deep packet inspection** of protocols like:
- **SMTP** – Email attacks (spam, malware)
- **DNS** – Botnet command-and-control detection
- **FTP** – Credential leakage

**Example: SMTP Inspection**
```bash
policy-map global_policy
 class inspection_default
  inspect smtp
```

---

## ✅ 3. Configuring Service Policies

---

### 3.1 🛠 Step-by-Step: Basic Policy Map

#### Step 1: Define a Class Map
```bash
class-map inspection_default
 match default-inspection-traffic
```

#### Step 2: Create a Policy Map
```bash
policy-map global_policy
 class inspection_default
  inspect http
  inspect smtp
  inspect dns
```

#### Step 3: Apply the Service Policy Globally
```bash
service-policy global_policy global
```

---

### 3.2 🎯 Prioritize Critical Services (e.g., VoIP)

#### Step 1: Classify VoIP Traffic
```bash
class-map match-any VoIP
 match protocol sip
 match protocol rtp
```

#### Step 2: Prioritize VoIP in Policy Map
```bash
policy-map global_policy
 class VoIP
  priority 512
```

#### Step 3: Apply Service Policy
```bash
service-policy global_policy global
```

> 🛡️ This ensures **SIP/RTP gets minimum 512 Kbps** and low latency.

---

### 3.3 📊 Monitoring & Verification

Use the following command to verify traffic matches and inspect statistics:
```bash
show service-policy
```

You’ll see:
- Class match counters
- Traffic inspected
- Policy actions triggered

> ✅ Use this to **validate** policies and **troubleshoot** issues.

## ✅ 4. Benefits of Service Policies

| Benefit                     | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Granular Traffic Control** | Define how different protocols or applications are handled.                 |
| **Advanced Security**        | Protect against app-layer attacks like malware, phishing, or exploits.     |
| **Performance Assurance**    | Prioritize VoIP, limit non-essential traffic (e.g., social media, P2P).     |
| **Compliance & Auditing**    | Ensure DPI and inspection meet internal/external security standards.        |

## 🚀 5. Final Thoughts

**Service Policies** on Cisco ASA are powerful tools that go far beyond simple traffic filtering. They enable:
- **Application-aware security enforcement**
- **Performance-based prioritization**
- **Real-time visibility and control**

> 🔧 Mastering service policies allows administrators to **balance security with performance**, protect against modern threats, and ensure **critical services run smoothly**.
