Alright, let's break this ACL (Access Control List) summary down properly based on what you posted:

---

### **ACL (Access Control List)**
- A set of rules applied to router interfaces that control whether packets are allowed or denied based on criteria like source IP, destination IP, ports, and protocols.
- **Purpose:** Improve security and traffic control.

---

### **Types of ACLs**
- **Normal (Standard) ACL**
  - Filters only by **source IP address**.
  - Syntax is simple.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    access-list 10 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
    ```
  
- **Extended ACL**
  - Filters by **source IP, destination IP, protocol**, and **port numbers** (like TCP/UDP ports).
  - Much more detailed control.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    access-list 100 permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 80
    ```
  
- **Numbered ACL**
  - ACLs are identified using a **number**.
    - Standard: **1â€“99** (and 1300â€“1999).
    - Extended: **100â€“199** (and 2000â€“2699).
  
- **Named ACL**
  - ACLs are identified using a **name** instead of a number.
  - Easier to read and modify later.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    ip access-list extended Block_HTTP
    permit tcp any any eq 80
    deny ip any any
    ```

---

### **Important Concept: Implicit Deny**
- Every ACL has an **implicit `deny all` at the end**, even if you don't see it written.
- If a packet doesn't match any rule, it's **automatically denied**.

---

### **Direction**
- **In**: Applies to traffic **entering** the interface.
- **Out**: Applies to traffic **leaving** the interface.

Example interface configuration:
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip access-group 100 in
```
