**TL;DR: 🔥 Module 09 – Firewall Technologies Overview**

Firewalls are essential security tools that monitor and control incoming/outgoing network traffic using rules.

### 🔐 Why Firewalls Matter:
- Block unauthorized users & threats (e.g. DoS, malware)
- Enforce security policies by filtering ports/protocols
- Segment networks (DMZs, internal zones)
- Provide visibility through traffic logging

### 🔧 Types of Firewalls:
- **Packet-Filtering** – Based on IPs, ports, protocols (basic ACLs)
- **Stateful** – Tracks connection states (dynamic filtering)
- **Application Layer** – Filters traffic like HTTP/FTP based on app data
- **NGFW** – Adds DPI, IPS, and malware defense
- **Proxy** – Hides internal IPs, inspects client-server traffic
- **Cloud-Based** – SaaS firewalls for cloud environments

### 🚀 Deployment Methods:
- **Host-Based** (local machine firewalls)
- **Network Firewalls** (e.g. Cisco ASA)
- **Cloud Firewalls** (e.g. AWS Security Groups)
- **DMZ Firewalls** (protecting public-facing servers)

### ⚙ How They Work:
- Evaluate source/destination IP, ports, protocols, state, and contents
- Apply rules to **allow or deny** traffic

### 📜 Example ACL:
Allow only web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS):
```bash
access-list 101 permit tcp any any eq 80
access-list 101 permit tcp any any eq 443
access-list 101 deny ip any any
```

### ✅ Best Practices:
- Use stateful firewalls + least privilege
- Log and monitor traffic
- Regularly update rules
- Combine multiple firewall types
- Test configs before deploying
