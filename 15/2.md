## 🔐 **15.2. Cryptography – Expanded Overview**

Cryptography is the **science of securing data and communication** through mathematical algorithms. It protects information by ensuring **confidentiality** (only authorized parties can read it), **integrity** (the data has not been altered), and **authenticity** (you know the source is legitimate). Whether securing email, protecting financial transactions, or enabling safe web browsing, cryptography is essential in nearly every digital interaction.

### 🌟 1. Key Concepts of Cryptography

#### **1.1. Encryption**
Encryption transforms readable **plaintext** into **ciphertext** using a mathematical algorithm and a key. Only someone with the correct decryption key can reverse the process.

- **Symmetric Encryption** (same key):
  - Fast and efficient
  - Requires secure key exchange
  - Examples: `AES`, `DES`, `3DES`
- **Asymmetric Encryption** (key pair: public + private):
  - Public key encrypts; private key decrypts
  - Secure over untrusted channels
  - Examples: `RSA`, `ECC`, `ElGamal`

> 🔐 **Use symmetric encryption for bulk data**, asymmetric for **key exchange or identity validation**.

---

#### **1.2. Hashing**
Hashing takes an input (message) and produces a **fixed-length digest** (hash). It's a one-way function: the original data **cannot be recovered** from the hash.

- Use: **Integrity verification**, password storage, digital signatures
- Examples:
  - `SHA-256` → Strong, widely used
  - `SHA-1` → Deprecated; vulnerable to collision attacks
  - `MD5` → Broken; do not use for security-critical operations

> 🧠 Even the smallest change in input will drastically change the output hash.

---

#### **1.3. Digital Signatures**
A **digital signature** is a cryptographic way to ensure that a message truly comes from the claimed sender and has not been altered.

- Process:
  1. Sender creates a **hash** of the message.
  2. Hash is **encrypted with sender's private key** → becomes the signature.
  3. Receiver **decrypts** with sender's public key → validates hash.
  4. Hash is compared to the locally generated hash of the message.

> ✔ Provides **authentication**, **integrity**, and **non-repudiation**.

---

#### **1.4. Key Management**
Effective **key management** is crucial for maintaining the strength of cryptographic systems.

- Includes:
  - Key generation
  - Distribution (e.g., certificate authorities)
  - Secure storage (e.g., HSMs)
  - Rotation and revocation
  - Expiry and renewal policies

> 🧱 Even the strongest encryption is weak if the keys are mismanaged.

### 🔑 2. Types of Cryptography

| **Type**                | **Description**                                                              | **Examples**                          |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Symmetric**           | Same key for encryption and decryption; fast but less scalable               | AES, DES, 3DES                         |
| **Asymmetric**          | Uses public/private key pair; slower but secure for open environments         | RSA, ECC, ElGamal                      |
| **Hash Functions**      | One-way functions to validate data integrity                                 | SHA-256, SHA-3, BLAKE2                 |
| **Hybrid Cryptography** | Combines symmetric + asymmetric for performance and security                 | TLS/SSL, PGP, S/MIME                   |

### 🛠️ 3. Cryptographic Services and Protocols

#### **3.1. SSL/TLS**
- **Purpose**: Secure web traffic with encryption and identity assurance
- **Tech Stack**: Symmetric + asymmetric + hashing
- **Use Cases**: HTTPS, email encryption, VPNs, secure APIs

#### **3.2. IPSec**
- **Purpose**: Secure IP packets across the network
- **Modes**:
  - **Transport Mode**: Encrypts only the payload
  - **Tunnel Mode**: Encrypts full packet (header + data)
- **Use Cases**: VPNs, secure LAN-to-LAN communication

#### **3.3. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)**
- **Purpose**: Secure email and file encryption using public-key cryptography
- **Supports**:
  - Data encryption
  - Digital signatures
  - Key distribution (web of trust or key servers)

> 🔑 PGP and GPG are often used interchangeably. GPG is the open-source implementation.
