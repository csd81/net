| **SHA-256 / SHA-3**  | Hash Function    | File integrity, blockchain, digital signatures, password hashing.                  |
| **MD5**              | Hash Function    | Legacy use only; insecure due to known collisions.                                 |
| **HMAC**             | MAC (Keyed Hash) | Data authenticity and integrity (TLS, IPSec, APIs).                                |
| **TLS (SSL/TLS Protocol)** | Hybrid     | Secure web communication (HTTPS), mail, VoIP.                                      |
| **IPSec**            | Protocol Suite   | VPN tunneling and IP-layer encryption.                                             |

| **DSA / ECDSA**      | Digital Signature | Digital document/email signing, software verification.                            |

## üõ°Ô∏è **Cryptanalysis Attacks vs. Defense Mechanisms**

| **Attack Type**            | **Description**                                                                 | **Defense Mechanism(s)**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Brute-Force Attack**     | Tries all possible keys to decrypt data.                                        | Use long, complex keys (e.g., AES-256, RSA-2048+); limit login attempts.                |
| **Ciphertext-Only Attack** | Attacker only sees encrypted data and attempts to deduce plaintext.             | Use strong, modern encryption with randomized IVs (e.g., AES-GCM).                      |
| **Known-Plaintext Attack** | Attacker has both plaintext and ciphertext pairs.                               | Use non-deterministic encryption (random IVs), modern ciphers.                          |
| **Chosen-Plaintext Attack**| Attacker chooses plaintexts and gets ciphertexts to analyze encryption pattern. | Use block ciphers resistant to differential analysis (e.g., AES); random padding.       |
| **Chosen-Ciphertext Attack**| Attacker submits ciphertexts to decrypt and learns info about the key.         | Use padding schemes (e.g., OAEP for RSA); avoid weak APIs; disable decryption oracles. |
| **Birthday Attack**        | Exploits hash collisions (two inputs ‚Üí same hash).                              | Use SHA-256/SHA-3 instead of MD5/SHA-1.                                                  |
| **Side-Channel Attack**    | Observes physical data (timing, power, EM) to extract keys.                     | Use constant-time algorithms; tamper-resistant hardware (HSMs, secure chips).           |
| **Replay Attack**          | Reuses captured data to fool authentication systems.                           | Use timestamps, nonces, and session tokens; implement anti-replay mechanisms.           |
| **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** | Intercepts and possibly alters communication between parties.                | Use mutual TLS authentication, certificate pinning, HSTS, DNSSEC.                      |

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- **Symmetric algorithms** like AES are fast and ideal for large data encryption.
- **Asymmetric algorithms** like RSA and ECC are crucial for key exchange and signatures.
- **Hash functions** verify integrity but must be collision-resistant (avoid MD5/SHA-1).
- Cryptographic **protocols** like TLS and IPSec combine these tools to secure communications.
- **Cryptanalysis** is not only about attacks‚Äîit's a feedback loop that **drives stronger encryption**.
