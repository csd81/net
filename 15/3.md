## 🔐 **15.3. Cryptanalysis – Expanded Overview**

**Cryptanalysis** is the study of how cryptographic algorithms can be **broken, bypassed, or subverted**. It is the adversarial counterpart to cryptography and plays a vital role in helping security professionals **identify flaws**, **improve encryption**, and **test resilience** against attacks.

Understanding cryptanalysis techniques doesn’t just help hackers—it's also essential for building more secure systems and algorithms.

| **Ciphertext-Only Attack**  | Attacker only sees ciphertext and attempts to infer the key or plaintext.       | Attacks on historical or poorly implemented ciphers |
| **Known-Plaintext Attack**  | Attacker knows both plaintext and ciphertext pairs.                            | Breaking symmetric ciphers like DES              |
| **Chosen-Plaintext Attack** | Attacker selects plaintexts and gets corresponding ciphertexts.                 | Side-channel analysis of block ciphers           |
| **Chosen-Ciphertext Attack**| Attacker decrypts chosen ciphertexts and uses results to find key.              | Attacks on improperly padded RSA                 |
| **Birthday Attack**         | Exploits probability theory to find hash collisions.                            | Cracking MD5/SHA-1 signatures                    |
| **Side-Channel Attack**     | Uses leaked information like timing, power use, or EM radiation.                | Hardware-based key extraction (e.g., smartcards) |

### 🛠️ 3. Key Cryptanalysis Techniques (Expanded)

#### ✅ **Brute-Force Attack**
- **Concept**: Exhaustively tries all possible key combinations.
- **Example**: Breaking a Caesar cipher or cracking short passwords.
- **Defense**: Use strong keys (e.g., 256-bit AES) to make brute-forcing computationally infeasible.

---

#### ✅ **Known-Plaintext Attack**
- **Concept**: Attacker knows both plaintext and ciphertext.
- **Example**: Used to break historical ciphers or weak modern implementations.
- **Defense**: Use ciphers that do not reveal patterns in ciphertext.

---

#### ✅ **Chosen-Plaintext Attack**
- **Concept**: Attacker can encrypt arbitrary plaintext and analyze the output.
- **Example**: Differential cryptanalysis of block ciphers like DES.
- **Defense**: Use modern ciphers resistant to chosen-plaintext attacks (e.g., AES).

---

#### ✅ **Chosen-Ciphertext Attack**
- **Concept**: Attacker can decrypt chosen ciphertexts (e.g., via API).
- **Example**: Bleichenbacher attack against RSA with improper padding (PKCS#1 v1.5).
- **Defense**: Use padding schemes like OAEP and constant-time decryption routines.

---

#### ✅ **Birthday Attack**
- **Concept**: Based on the birthday paradox, it exploits hash collisions.
- **Example**: Finding two files with the same MD5 hash.
- **Defense**: Use large-output hash functions (SHA-256, SHA-3).

---

#### ✅ **Side-Channel Attack**
- **Concept**: Observes physical leakage like power use or timing differences.
- **Example**: Differential Power Analysis (DPA) on a smartcard.
- **Defense**:
  - Constant-time algorithms
  - Noise injection
  - Shielded hardware (e.g., tamper-proof HSMs)

### 🛡️ 4. Defending Against Cryptanalysis

| ✅ Defense Strategy                | 🔍 How It Helps |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Use Modern Algorithms**        | AES, RSA-2048, ECC protect against known attack vectors. |
| **Secure Key Management**        | Protects against brute-force and known-key recovery attacks. |
| **Strong Hashing Algorithms**    | SHA-256, SHA-3 resist birthday and collision attacks. |
| **Padding Validation**           | Prevents chosen-ciphertext vulnerabilities (e.g., RSA attacks). |
| **Multi-Factor Authentication**  | Protects access even if cryptographic protections are bypassed. |
| **Regular Key Rotation**         | Limits the damage from leaked or guessed keys. |
| **Side-Channel Resistance**      | Harden hardware and ensure constant-time execution. |
