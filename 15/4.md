## 🔐 **15.4. Cryptology – Expanded Overview**

**Cryptology** is the umbrella discipline that includes both:
- **Cryptography** – the creation of secure communication systems.
- **Cryptanalysis** – the breaking or testing of those systems for weaknesses.

Cryptology is the scientific foundation for secure digital communication, enabling **confidentiality, integrity, authentication,** and **non-repudiation** across untrusted networks. From secure messaging to cryptocurrency, it is a key enabler of trust in the digital world.

### 🛠️ 3. Types of Cryptographic Systems

#### ✅ **Symmetric Cryptography (Secret-Key)**
- **Key**: Same key for both encryption and decryption.
- **Examples**: `AES`, `DES`, `3DES`
- **Use Cases**: Disk encryption, VPN traffic, secure data at rest.

#### ✅ **Asymmetric Cryptography (Public-Key)**
- **Key Pair**: Public key encrypts, private key decrypts.
- **Examples**: `RSA`, `ECC`, `ElGamal`
- **Use Cases**: SSL/TLS, digital signatures, key exchange, email encryption.

#### ✅ **Hash Functions**
- **Purpose**: One-way digest for verifying data integrity.
- **Examples**: `SHA-256`, `SHA-3`, `BLAKE2`
- **Use Cases**: File verification, blockchain, password hashing.

#### ✅ **Digital Signatures**
- **Purpose**: Authenticate sender and verify message integrity.
- **Examples**: `RSA Signatures`, `DSA`, `ECDSA`
- **Use Cases**: Signed documents, code signing, secure email.
