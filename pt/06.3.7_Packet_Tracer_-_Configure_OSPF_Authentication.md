Here’s a full breakdown and explanation of **6.3.7 Packet Tracer – Configure OSPF Authentication**, including the **goal, step-by-step actions, and why each step is important**.

---

## 🔐 **Objective**

To **secure routing updates** between routers using **OSPF MD5 authentication** within **OSPF area 0**.

Without authentication, routers could be tricked into accepting bad routing information. MD5 ensures only routers with the correct password exchange routes.

---

## 🖧 **Topology Summary**

### Devices Involved:
- **R1 ↔ R2 ↔ R3** connected via point-to-point links (OSPF Area 0)
- **PC-A / PC-B** in R1’s LAN (`192.168.1.x`)
- **PC-C** in R3’s LAN (`192.168.3.x`)

### Important Interface IPs:

| Router | Interface | IP Address      | Purpose                |
|--------|-----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| R1     | G0/0/0    | 10.1.1.1         | Link to R2              |
| R1     | G0/0/1    | 192.168.1.1      | LAN with PC-A & PC-B    |
| R2     | G0/0/0    | 10.1.1.2         | Link to R1              |
| R2     | G0/0/1    | 10.2.2.2         | Link to R3              |
| R3     | G0/0/0    | 10.2.2.1         | Link to R2              |
| R3     | G0/0/1    | 192.168.3.1      | LAN with PC-C           |

## ⚙️ **Step-by-Step Configuration**

### ✅ Step 1: Test Connectivity
Make sure all devices can ping each other first. This confirms that:
- IP addressing is correct
- Interfaces are up
- OSPF neighbors are forming (before authentication)

---

### ✅ Step 2: Enable MD5 Authentication for OSPF Area 0

#### On **all routers**:
```bash
router ospf 1
area 0 authentication message-digest
```

🔒 This command sets the requirement for MD5-based authentication for **all OSPF interfaces** in Area 0.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Configure OSPF MD5 Key on Interfaces

Use:
```bash
ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 MD5pa55
```
> The `1` is the key ID, and `MD5pa55` is the shared password.

#### On **R1**:
```bash
interface g0/0/0
 ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 MD5pa55
```

#### On **R2** (connects to both R1 and R3):
```bash
interface g0/0/0
 ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 MD5pa55

interface g0/0/1
 ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 MD5pa55
```

#### On **R3**:
```bash
interface g0/0/0
 ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 MD5pa55
```

📌 **All routers must use the same key and password** on the interfaces forming OSPF neighbor relationships. Otherwise, adjacency will fail.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Verification

#### a. Use this command to verify:
```bash
show ip ospf interface
```
It shows:
- OSPF interface state
- Whether MD5 authentication is enabled
- Key ID being used

#### b. Test **ping** between end devices (e.g., PC-A to PC-C) to confirm routing is still functional **after authentication is enabled**.

## 📜 **Answer Scripts Recap**

### **R1**
```bash
conf t
interface g0/0/0
 ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 MD5pa55
router ospf 1
 area 0 authentication message-digest
end
```

### **R2**
```bash
conf t
interface g0/0/0
 ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 MD5pa55
interface g0/0/1
 ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 MD5pa55
router ospf 1
 area 0 authentication message-digest
end
```

### **R3**
```bash
conf t
interface g0/0/0
 ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 MD5pa55
router ospf 1
 area 0 authentication message-digest
end
```

## ✅ Summary

| Task | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Enable OSPF MD5 | Secures routing updates |
| Same password/key on both ends | Ensures OSPF neighbor formation |
| Use `show ip ospf interface` | Confirms MD5 is active |
| End-to-end ping | Confirms connectivity after security |
