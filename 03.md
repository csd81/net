Here’s an **expanded and detailed explanation** of **03.0. Module 03: Mitigating Threats Introduction**, perfect for study, training, or documentation:

---

## 🛡️ **03.0. Module 03: Mitigating Threats – Introduction**

### 📘 Overview:
Modern cyber threats are **constantly evolving**, making it essential for organizations to implement **strong, adaptive defenses**. This module emphasizes a **strategic approach to mitigation** that includes both **prevention** and **response**.

---

### ⚔️ What is Threat Mitigation?

**Threat mitigation** refers to the processes and technologies used to **reduce the likelihood** or **impact of cyberattacks**. It doesn’t just stop attacks—it **limits damage** and enables **quick recovery**.

Mitigation strategies fall into **three main categories**:

---

### 🔍 1. **Proactive Defense**
> Focus: **Prevent** attacks before they occur.

**Key Strategies:**
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regularly scan systems and software for known security weaknesses.
- **Patch Management**: Keep all systems, applications, and firmware up to date.
- **Security Hardening**: Disable unused ports/services, remove default accounts, enforce strong configurations.
- **Access Controls**: Use principles of **least privilege**, enforce **strong authentication** (like MFA).
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate sensitive systems from less secure areas of the network.

**Example**:  
Applying a critical patch to fix a known vulnerability before it’s exploited by a ransomware campaign.

---

### 🚨 2. **Reactive Defense**
> Focus: **Detect**, **respond to**, and **recover** from attacks.

**Key Strategies:**
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**: Alert or block suspicious traffic.
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**: Centralize log data and correlate it to detect attacks in real time.
- **Incident Response Plan (IRP)**: Predefined steps for identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents.
- **Digital Forensics**: Analyze compromised systems to understand how the breach occurred and prevent recurrence.
- **Backups & Recovery**: Regular, tested backups ensure quick recovery from ransomware or data loss.

**Example**:  
A phishing email leads to a compromised endpoint, but the SIEM alerts security staff who isolate the device and stop the spread.

---

### 🧱 3. **Layered Approach (Defense in Depth)**
> Focus: Use **multiple, overlapping defenses** so that if one layer fails, others still protect the system.

**Defense-in-Depth Layers**:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Physical Security** | Secure access to servers, networking hardware, and offices |
| **Network Security** | Firewalls, VPNs, segmentation, NAC (Network Access Control) |
| **Host Security** | Antivirus, endpoint protection, OS hardening |
| **Application Security** | Input validation, secure coding, patching web services |
| **Data Security** | Encryption, DLP, backups |
| **User Awareness** | Security training and social engineering awareness |
| **Administrative Controls** | Policies, access control, role-based security |

**Why It Matters**:  
No single security measure is foolproof. By layering protections, an organization increases the **chances of detecting and stopping an attack at multiple stages**.

---

### ✅ Summary of This Module's Goals:
- Understand the need for **multi-layered security**
- Learn to apply **proactive** and **reactive** controls
- Focus on **preparedness**, **detection**, and **resilience**

In 2017, **Equifax** suffered a data breach that exposed the personal data of over **147 million people**. The breach was caused by a **known Apache Struts vulnerability** (CVE-2017-5638) that had a patch available **months before the attack**.

**What Went Wrong**:  
Equifax failed to apply the patch in time.

**Proactive Defense That Could’ve Helped**:
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- An enforced patch management policy
- An automated patching system
- Asset inventory to track vulnerable systems

**Lesson**:  
Keeping software up to date is one of the **simplest and most effective** proactive strategies.

---

### 🚨 **2. Reactive Defense Example: SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack (2020)**

**Incident**:  
Attackers compromised SolarWinds’ software updates and inserted malicious code into **Orion**, a network management tool used by government and enterprise organizations.

**What Helped Detect It**:
- **CrowdStrike**, **FireEye**, and **U.S. agencies** noticed suspicious outbound traffic
- Use of **SIEM tools** and **advanced threat detection**
- Post-breach, companies activated **incident response plans**, isolated systems, and analyzed indicators of compromise (IOCs)

**Reactive Defense Techniques Used**:
- Incident response teams were activated
- Forensics was used to track the origin of the breach
- Patching and cleanup followed immediately

**Lesson**:  
Even advanced, stealthy attacks can be contained if strong **monitoring and response frameworks** are in place.

---

### 🧱 **3. Layered Security (Defense-in-Depth): Target Retail Breach (2013)**

**Incident**:  
Attackers gained access to **Target’s network** through a compromised third-party HVAC vendor account. They moved laterally and stole **credit card data from PoS systems**.

**Failures**:
- Lack of proper **network segmentation** between vendor access and critical systems
- Missed alerts from security monitoring tools

**How a Layered Approach Could Have Helped**:
- **Vendor access control** with zero trust principles

- ✅ **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**
- ✅ **Secure Shell (SSH)** for secure remote management

---

## ⚙️ 1. **Control Plane Policing (CoPP) – Cisco IOS Example**

**Goal**: Rate-limit specific traffic (like ICMP, BGP, SSH) to protect the router’s control plane from overload.

### 🔧 Example: Limit ICMP traffic to the control plane

```cisco
! Define a class map to match ICMP
class-map match-any ICMP-TRAFFIC
 match protocol icmp

! Define a policy map to limit traffic
policy-map CONTROL-PLANE-POLICY
 class ICMP-TRAFFIC
  police 64000 8000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop

! Apply policy to control plane
control-plane
 service-policy input CONTROL-PLANE-POLICY
```

📝 **Explanation**:
- `police 64000 8000`: Limits to 64 kbps with 8000 byte burst.
- `exceed-action drop`: Drops traffic exceeding that rate.

---

## 🔐 2. **Access Control List (ACL) – Cisco IOS Example**

**Goal**: Permit management access from a specific IP (e.g., admin PC), deny all others.

### 🔧 Example: Restrict SSH to one trusted IP

```cisco
! Create an extended ACL to permit only a trusted host
ip access-list extended MGMT-ACCESS
 permit tcp host 192.168.10.100 any eq 22
 deny tcp any any eq 22
 permit ip any any

! Apply it to the VTY lines
line vty 0 4
 access-class MGMT-ACCESS in
 transport input ssh
```

📝 **Explanation**:
- Only IP `192.168.10.100` can SSH into the device.
- All other SSH attempts are blocked.
- `access-class` applies to inbound VTY connections.

---

## 🔐 3. **Enabling SSH on a Cisco Router or Switch**

**Goal**: Disable insecure Telnet access and enforce encrypted SSH.

### 🔧 SSH Configuration Steps:

```cisco
! Set hostname and domain name (needed for key generation)
hostname R1
ip domain-name example.com

! Generate RSA key pair for SSH
crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048

! Create a local user for SSH access
username admin privilege 15 secret StrongP@ssword123

! Enable SSH version 2
ip ssh version 2

! Apply SSH-only access to VTY lines
line vty 0 4
 login local
 transport input ssh
```

📝 **Best Practices**:
- Use **modulus 2048 or higher** for strong encryption.
- Always use `login local` with `username` and `secret`.
- Consider combining this with an **ACL** to limit SSH to trusted IPs.
