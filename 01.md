## üåê Network Security Fundamentals

---

### üåç 1. Networks Are Targets

- Networks are **constantly under attack**.
- High-profile breaches are frequently in the news.
- Tools like the **Kaspersky Cyberthreat Real-Time Map** show **live attack activity worldwide**.
- Other similar monitoring tools provide **real-time cyber threat intelligence**.

---

### üîí 2. Reasons for Network Security

Network security is essential for:

- **Business continuity**
- **Protecting sensitive information**

Risks of breaches:

- **Disruption** of services (e.g., e-commerce downtime)
- **Data loss**
- **Privacy violations**
- **Financial loss**
- **Legal consequences**

Key Resources:

- **Cisco Talos Intelligence Group**: Threat intelligence platform.

### ‚öîÔ∏è 3. Vectors of Network Attacks

#### Attack vectors: How attackers gain access

**External threats**:
- Denial-of-Service (DoS) / DDoS
- Malware (viruses, worms, ransomware)
- Phishing & social engineering

**Internal threats**:
- Unauthorized data access
- Privilege misuse
- Connecting infected or compromised devices

> **Note**: Internal threats are often more dangerous due to **privileged access** and **trust**.

---

### üìâ 4. Data Loss

Data is a critical asset. Loss or theft leads to:

- **Brand damage** & loss of trust
- **Loss of customers** and revenue
- **Loss of competitive edge**
- **Legal and regulatory penalties**
- **High recovery and investigation costs**

#### Common vectors of data loss:

- **Email/social networking**: Message interception
- **Unencrypted devices**: Stolen or lost laptops, phones
- **Cloud storage**: Misconfigured access policies
- **Removable media**: USB drives, lost or misused
- **Hard copy documents**: Poor disposal methods
- **Weak access control**: Guessable or leaked passwords

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è 5. Cloud Networks & Virtualization
**Definition**: Use of cloud to expand capabilities without new hardware.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Virtualization**: Multiple VMs on a single physical server.
- **Cloud Computing**: External services beyond traditional perimeters.

**Security Risks**:
- **Hyperjacking**: Attackers compromise hypervisors.
- **Instant-On Activation**: Dormant VMs activating without updated security.
- **AV Storms**: Simultaneous antivirus scans drain resources.

---

### üö∂ 6. The Evolving Network Border
**Modern Challenge**: Secure access in a mobile and BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) world.

**Solutions**:
- **Cisco Borderless Network**: Secure access from any device/location.
- **Mobile Device Management (MDM)**:
  - **Encryption**: Only encrypted devices allowed.
  - **PIN Enforcement**
  - **Remote Data Wipe**
  - **Jailbreak/Root Detection**
