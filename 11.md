# 🚨 Module 11: IPS Technologies – Introduction

**Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)** are critical cybersecurity technologies that detect, analyze, and prevent threats **in real time**. Unlike firewalls that mainly control access, IPS actively **blocks malicious traffic** before it can cause harm.

---

## 🌟 1. Why Are IPS Technologies Important?

✅ **Real-Time Threat Prevention** – Stops attacks before they reach your network.  
✅ **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)** – Analyzes packet contents for malicious patterns.  
✅ **Signature-Based Detection** – Matches traffic against a database of known attacks.  
✅ **Anomaly-Based Detection** – Identifies abnormal behavior to catch unknown threats.  
✅ **Complements Firewalls** – Provides an extra layer of active protection.

## 🔑 2. Intrusion Detection vs. Intrusion Prevention

| Feature                     | Intrusion Detection System (IDS)         | Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)         |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Function**        | Monitors and detects attacks             | Detects and actively blocks attacks       |
| **Traffic Handling**        | Passive – sends alerts                   | Active – blocks traffic automatically     |
| **Placement**               | Inside network for monitoring            | Inline with traffic flow                  |
| **Response**                | Logs and alerts                          | Blocks malicious packets in real time     |

🔹 *IPS is proactive, while IDS is reactive. Many modern systems combine both.*

---

# 🔥 11.1. IDS and IPS Characteristics

**Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** and **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)** are essential cybersecurity tools. While both monitor traffic for malicious activity, they differ in how they respond to threats.

---

## 🌟 1. What is an IDS (Intrusion Detection System)?

An **IDS** is a **passive monitoring tool**. It **detects and alerts** on suspicious activity but does **not block** or interrupt the traffic.

### ✅ Key Characteristics of IDS

✔ Real-time monitoring without traffic interruption  
✔ Generates alerts/logs for potential threats  
✔ Operates **out-of-band** (traffic is mirrored to IDS)  
✔ Requires **manual intervention** to respond  
✔ **Low impact** on network performance

### 📌 Example Use Cases

🔹 Detecting port scans or reconnaissance attempts  

🔹 Logging brute-force login attempts  

🔹 Alerting on unusual bandwidth or traffic patterns

---

## 🌟 2. What is an IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)?

An **IPS** is an **active security device**. It analyzes traffic in real time and can **automatically block malicious traffic**.

### ✅ Key Characteristics of IPS

✔ Detects and blocks threats **in real-time**  
✔ Operates **in-line** between network devices  
✔ Takes **automated actions** (drop packets, block IPs, update firewall rules)  
✔ Prevents DoS, brute-force, and exploit attempts  
✔ May slightly **impact network latency**

### 📌 Example Use Cases

🔹 Blocking **SQL injection** and **XSS** attacks  

🔹 Stopping **brute-force logins** to servers  

🔹 Preventing **malware communication** with C2 servers

|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Function**         | Detects malicious activity only             | Detects and blocks threats                  |
| **Traffic Handling** | Out-of-band (passive monitoring)            | In-line (active filtering)                  |
| **Response**         | Sends alerts/logs                           | Takes immediate automated action            |
| **Performance**      | No impact on network traffic                | Slight latency possible                     |
| **Admin Action**     | Requires manual intervention                | Operates autonomously                       |
| **Use Case**         | Visibility and analysis                     | Real-time prevention                        |

monitor session 3 destination remote vlan 999
```

#### 3️⃣ Configure Destination SPAN Session on **Switch B**
```plaintext
monitor session 4 source remote vlan 999
monitor session 4 destination interface GigabitEthernet0/2
```
