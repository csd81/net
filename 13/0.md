# 🔐 Module 13: Endpoint Security Introduction

**Endpoint Security** is a critical area of cybersecurity focused on protecting end-user devices—such as computers, servers, mobile devices, and IoT—from cyber threats. Since endpoints are common entry points for attacks, securing them is essential to prevent malware infections, data breaches, and unauthorized access.

## 🌟 1. Why Is Endpoint Security Important?

✅ **Protects End-User Devices** – Prevents malware, ransomware, and unauthorized access.  
✅ **Reduces Attack Surface** – Secures endpoints before threats can spread.  
✅ **Ensures Data Protection** – Helps avoid data breaches and information theft.  
✅ **Improves Compliance** – Aids in meeting standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.  
✅ **Prevents Insider Threats** – Monitors user activity and blocks suspicious behavior.

## 🔑 2. Key Components of Endpoint Security

| **Security Component**             | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Antivirus & Anti-Malware**      | Detects and removes viruses, trojans, ransomware, and spyware.                 |
| **Endpoint Detection & Response** | Monitors and responds to suspicious activities in real time.                   |
| **Host-Based Firewalls**          | Blocks unauthorized inbound and outbound connections.                          |
| **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**    | Prevents sensitive data from being leaked or stolen.                           |
| **Application Control**           | Restricts which applications can run on an endpoint.                           |
| **Patch Management**              | Keeps systems up to date with the latest security patches.                     |
| **Zero Trust Security**           | Continuously verifies identities and device trustworthiness.                   |

## ✅ 5. Best Practices for Endpoint Security

✔ **Use NGAV and EDR** – Detect both known and unknown threats.  
✔ **Enforce Strong Authentication** – Require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).  
✔ **Keep Systems Updated** – Apply patches regularly to OS and applications.  
✔ **Apply Least Privilege Access** – Give users only the permissions they need.  
✔ **Enable Endpoint Firewalls** – Block unauthorized network access.  
✔ **Monitor Endpoint Activity** – Use SIEM and EDR for real-time alerts.  
✔ **Educate Employees** – Train staff on phishing, malware, and secure browsing.
