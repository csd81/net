# 🔐 13.2. 802.1X Authentication

**802.1X Authentication** is a network access control protocol that provides secure authentication for both **wired** and **wireless** networks. It ensures that only authorized users and devices can connect to the network.

---

## 🌟 1. Why Use 802.1X Authentication?

✅ **Prevents Unauthorized Access** – Only authenticated devices can connect.  
✅ **Enhances Security** – Blocks rogue devices and prevents network spoofing.  
✅ **Supports Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Assigns policies based on user identity.  
✅ **Works on Wired & Wireless Networks** – Protects switch ports, wireless APs, and VPNs.  
✅ **Ensures Compliance** – Meets PCI-DSS, HIPAA, NIST, and other security standards.

## 🔑 2. How 802.1X Authentication Works

802.1X uses three core components:

| **Component**               | **Role**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Supplicant**              | The client device requesting access (e.g., laptop, smartphone).          |
| **Authenticator**           | The network device (e.g., switch or access point) that controls access.  |
| **Authentication Server**   | Verifies credentials and makes access decisions (e.g., RADIUS server).   |

---

### ✅ Authentication Flow

1️⃣ **Supplicant** (User device) requests access and sends credentials.  
2️⃣ **Authenticator** (Switch/AP) forwards the request using **EAP** (Extensible Authentication Protocol).  
3️⃣ **Authentication Server** (e.g., FreeRADIUS or Cisco ISE) verifies the credentials.  
4️⃣ If authentication succeeds → access is granted.  
  If it fails → the device is denied or placed into a **guest VLAN**.

## 🛠️ 3. Configuring 802.1X on a Cisco Switch

### ✅ Step 1: Enable 802.1X Globally

```bash
conf t
aaa new-model
aaa authentication dot1x default group radius
dot1x system-auth-control
```
🔹 Enables the AAA model and activates 802.1X system-wide.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Configure the RADIUS Server

```bash
radius-server host 192.168.1.100 key MySecretKey
```
🔹 Specifies the RADIUS server used for authentication.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Apply 802.1X to a Switch Interface

```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 authentication port-control auto
 dot1x pae authenticator
```
🔹 Enforces authentication on the specified interface.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Verify 802.1X Status

```bash
show dot1x all
```
🔹 Displays 802.1X authentication status for all interfaces.

## 🔍 4. 802.1X Authentication Methods

| **Method**    | **Description**                                          | **Use Case**                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **EAP-TLS**   | Uses digital certificates for mutual authentication.     | Most secure; ideal for enterprise environments.|
| **EAP-PEAP**  | Encrypts credentials using a TLS tunnel.                 | Common with Active Directory (AD).            |
| **EAP-MD5**   | Uses simple password-based authentication.               | Legacy support only; not recommended.         |

> 🔹 **EAP-TLS** is the most secure option, eliminating password-based attacks.

## ✅ 5. Best Practices for 802.1X Deployment

✔ **Use a RADIUS Server** (e.g., Cisco ISE, FreeRADIUS) – Centralized authentication and policy control.  
✔ **Deploy EAP-TLS with Certificates** – Ensures strong, certificate-based security.  
✔ **Enable Guest VLANs** – Provides limited access for unauthenticated devices.  
✔ **Use MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB)** – Authenticates IoT and non-802.1X devices.  
✔ **Monitor Authentication Logs** – Detects anomalies, failed attempts, or attacks.

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

802.1X Authentication is a cornerstone of modern network security. It ensures that only verified and authorized devices can connect, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access. For robust protection, **combine 802.1X with RADIUS and EAP-TLS** in enterprise environments.
