## ✅ 2. Core ASA Firewall Configuration Concepts

This section outlines the **key areas** involved in configuring the ASA firewall.

---

### 1. 🛠 Initial ASA Setup
- **Console or SSH Access**: Start configuration using the console cable or over SSH.
- **Basic Setup**:
  - Hostname and domain name
  - Enable password
  - Management interface configuration
  - Timezone and logging preferences

---

### 2. 🌐 Interface Configuration
- **Nameif**: Assign a logical name (e.g., inside, outside, DMZ).
- **Security Levels**:
  - **0 (lowest)** for untrusted networks like the internet.
  - **100 (highest)** for internal, trusted networks.
  - ASA allows traffic from high-to-low by default; low-to-high requires access control rules.

**Example**:
```bash
interface Ethernet0/0
 nameif outside
 security-level 0
 ip address 203.0.113.1 255.255.255.0

interface Ethernet0/1
 nameif inside
 security-level 100
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
```

---

### 3. 📋 Access Control Policies
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** define traffic flow rules.
- Apply ACLs to interfaces using `access-group`.

**Example**:
```bash
access-list outside_access_in extended permit ip any any
access-group outside_access_in in interface outside
```

---

### 4. 🔁 NAT (Network Address Translation)
- NAT allows internal hosts with **private IPs** to access the internet.
- Supports **dynamic**, **static**, and **PAT** (Port Address Translation).

**Static NAT Example**:
```bash
object network obj_any
 nat (inside,outside) static 203.0.113.100
```

---

### 5. 🔐 VPN Configuration

#### **Remote Access VPN (SSL VPN)**
- Clientless access through browser.
```bash
webvpn
 enable outside
```

#### **Site-to-Site VPN (IPsec)**
- Tunnel between two networks.
```bash
crypto ipsec ikev1 transform-set myset esp-aes-256 esp-sha-hmac
crypto map mymap 10 match address vpn-acl
crypto map mymap 10 set peer 198.51.100.2
crypto map mymap 10 set transform-set myset
crypto map mymap interface outside
```

hostname ASA_Firewall
domain-name example.com
```

This helps with internal DNS resolution and certificate generation for VPN/SSL services.

---

### 2.2 🌐 Configuring Interfaces

ASA uses **security levels** to define trust:
- **Inside (Trusted)**: Level 100
- **Outside (Untrusted)**: Level 0
- **DMZ (Semi-trusted)**: Intermediate level (e.g., 50)

**Example: Configuring Inside and Outside Interfaces**
```bash
interface Ethernet0/0
 nameif outside
 security-level 0
 ip address 203.0.113.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown

interface Ethernet0/1
 nameif inside
 security-level 100
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```

---

### 2.3 🛡 Configuring Management Access

Allow secure remote access using **SSH** (and optionally ASDM via HTTPS):

```bash
management-access inside
ssh 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 inside
```

> `management-access inside`: Enables management from the inside interface  
> `ssh ...`: Restricts SSH access to devices in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet

---

### 2.4 📜 Enabling Console Logging and Buffering

Enable logs to monitor events and detect issues:

```bash
logging console notifications
logging buffer-size 4096

**Example: Allow All IP Traffic from Inside**
```bash
access-list inside_access_in extended permit ip any any
access-group inside_access_in in interface inside
```

Use more restrictive ACLs in production environments to limit exposure.

---

### 3.2 🔁 NAT Configuration (PAT)

Use NAT to allow internal users to access the internet using a single public IP (Port Address Translation).

```bash
object network obj_any
 subnet 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
 nat (inside,outside) dynamic interface
```

> This NAT rule translates all inside addresses to the ASA’s outside interface IP (e.g., 203.0.113.1).

---

## ✅ 4. Saving Configuration

To ensure your changes persist after reboot:

```bash
write memory
```

This saves the **running-config** to **startup-config**.

---

## 🚀 5. Final Thoughts

A **basic ASA firewall configuration** establishes the foundation for a secure network perimeter. By setting up **interfaces**, **security levels**, **NAT**, **ACLs**, and **management access**, you create a protective gateway between trusted and untrusted networks.

---

## 🔐 21.3. Object Groups in Cisco ASA

### 🔎 Overview

**Object Groups** in Cisco ASA firewalls help administrators manage complex configurations by grouping related entities such as **IP addresses**, **networks**, **ports**, and **protocols**. These groups are reusable throughout the configuration—most notably in **ACLs**, **NAT rules**, and **VPN policies**—allowing for **simpler**, **more readable**, and **scalable** security policies.

Using object groups promotes **modular configuration**, reduces redundancy, and helps ensure **consistency** across policies.

---

## 🌟 1. Types of Object Groups

Cisco ASA supports several types of object groups. Here are the most commonly used:

---

### 1.1 🌐 Network Object Groups

Group multiple **IP addresses** or **subnets** for use in ACLs or NAT rules.

**Example: Define a Network Object Group**
```bash
object-group network MyNetworks
 network-object 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
 network-object 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0
```

- `MyNetworks`: Group name.
- `network-object`: Adds an IP range or subnet to the group.

---

### 1.2 🔐 Service Object Groups

Group multiple **TCP/UDP ports** or **services** used in access policies.

**Example: TCP Service Group**
```bash
object-group service MyServices tcp
 service-object eq 80
 service-object eq 443
 service-object eq 22
```

- Useful for grouping **web and SSH services**.

---

### 1.3 📡 Protocol Object Groups

Group **transport layer protocols** like ICMP, TCP, and UDP into a single object.

**Example: Protocol Group**
```bash
object-group protocol MyProtocols
 protocol-object icmp
 protocol-object tcp
 protocol-object udp
```

---

## ✅ 2. Using Object Groups in Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Object groups simplify ACL configuration by replacing multiple lines with a single reference.

---

### 2.1 Using Network Object Group in ACL
```bash
access-list outside_access_in extended permit ip object-group MyNetworks any
```

- Allows **any traffic from defined networks** to any destination.

---

### 2.2 Using Service Object Group in ACL
```bash
access-list outside_access_in extended permit tcp any object-group MyServices
```

- Allows **TCP traffic** to ports **80, 443, and 22** from **any source**.

---

## ✅ 3. Using Object Groups in NAT Configuration

You can use object groups in **static or dynamic NAT** to apply rules to **multiple addresses or services**.

---

### 3.1 Network Object Group in NAT
```bash
object-group network MyNetworks
 network-object 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
 network-object 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0

nat (inside,outside) source static object-group MyNetworks interface
```

- Translates IPs in `MyNetworks` group to the ASA’s outside interface IP.

---

### 3.2 Service Object Group in NAT
```bash
object-group service MyServices tcp
 service-object eq 80
 service-object eq 443

nat (inside,outside) source static any object-group MyServices interface
```

- Translates **incoming service requests** for **ports 80 and 443**.

---

## ✅ 4. Advantages of Using Object Groups

| Advantage            | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Simplification**   | Reduces repetition and creates more readable configurations.                |
| **Centralized Edits**| Changing an object group updates all references across the config.          |
| **Consistency**      | Enforces uniform security policy across rules.                              |
| **Scalability**      | Easily accommodate changes as networks grow or change.                      |

---

## 🛠 Example: Real-World ACL with Object Groups

```bash
object-group network Trusted_LANs
 network-object 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0
 network-object 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0

object-group service Allowed_Services tcp
 service-object eq 22
 service-object eq 443

access-list OUTSIDE_IN extended permit tcp object-group Trusted_LANs any object-group Allowed_Services
access-group OUTSIDE_IN in interface outside
```

- This rule permits **SSH and HTTPS** from two trusted subnets to any external address.

---

## 🚀 5. Final Thoughts

**Object Groups** are an essential tool for scalable and manageable Cisco ASA configurations. They streamline the process of:
- Writing and modifying **ACLs**
- Defining **NAT rules**
- Creating **VPN access policies**

By abstracting multiple values into reusable components, object groups help maintain **clarity**, **reduce errors**, and **save time**—especially in larger environments where policy reuse and centralized changes are key.

---

## 🔐 21.4. ASA ACLs (Access Control Lists)

### 🔎 Overview

**Access Control Lists (ACLs)** on a Cisco ASA are foundational to securing the firewall and controlling traffic between networks. ACLs determine what traffic is **allowed or denied** based on criteria like **IP addresses**, **protocols**, and **ports**. Whether filtering **inbound internet traffic**, restricting **internal access**, or allowing **VPN connections**, ACLs provide **granular control** over your network's security posture.

ACLs are often paired with **object groups** and **time-ranges** to enhance efficiency and manageability.

---

## 🌟 1. What Are ASA ACLs?

ACLs consist of **sequential rules** that define traffic handling:
- **Permit or deny** traffic based on conditions.
- **Applied to interfaces** to inspect traffic entering or leaving the firewall.
- **Processed top-down**; the first match applies.

ACLs are used to:
- Enforce **security zones** between internal, DMZ, and external networks.
- Permit or block **specific applications** (e.g., HTTP, SSH).
- Log **traffic events** for monitoring and compliance.

---

## ✅ 2. Types of ACLs in ASA

### 2.1 📋 Standard ACLs

Filter traffic based **only on the source IP address**.

```bash
access-list inside_access standard permit 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
```

> ✅ Use case: Allowing certain subnets to access a resource.

---

### 2.2 📋 Extended ACLs

Offer **fine-grained control**, filtering by:
- **Source/Destination IPs**
- **Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)**
- **Port numbers**

**Example: Allow HTTP**
```bash
access-list outside_access_in extended permit tcp 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 any eq 80
```

> ✅ Use case: Allow only HTTP traffic from internal clients.

---

### 2.3 📁 Object-Based ACLs

Use **object groups** for IPs, subnets, and ports to simplify configurations.

**Example: Allow grouped networks**
```bash
object-group network MyNetworks
 network-object 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
 network-object 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0

access-list outside_access_in extended permit ip object-group MyNetworks any
```

> ✅ Simplifies management and improves scalability.

---

## ✅ 3. ACL Configuration Steps

### 3.1 🛠 Creating an ACL

Define rules using the `access-list` command.

**Example: Allow TCP port 80**
```bash
access-list OUTSIDE_IN extended permit tcp any any eq 80
```

---

### 3.2 🎯 Applying ACL to an Interface

Use `access-group` to bind an ACL to an interface.

**Example: Apply to outside interface**
```bash
access-group OUTSIDE_IN in interface outside
```

- `in`: Traffic coming **into** the ASA on this interface.
- `out`: Traffic **leaving** the interface.

---

### 3.3 🔍 Verifying ACLs

Use the following to verify rule application and hit counts:
```bash
show access-list
show run access-group
```

> ✅ Helps in troubleshooting and auditing rule effectiveness.

---

## ✅ 4. Advanced ACL Features

### 4.1 🧾 Logging ACL Matches

Append `log` to the rule to generate syslog messages.

```bash
access-list OUTSIDE_IN extended permit tcp any any eq 80 log
```

- Logs **matched packets** and their details.
- Can be viewed in **syslog** or **ASDM**.

---

### 4.2 🌍 Using the `any` Keyword

The `any` keyword matches **all IP addresses**.

```bash
access-list INSIDE_IN extended deny icmp any any
```

- Blocks **all ping/ICMP traffic**.

---

### 4.3 ⏰ Time-Based ACLs

Control traffic based on the time of day or week.

```bash
time-range BusinessHours
 periodic weekdays 08:00 to 18:00

access-list OUTSIDE_IN extended permit tcp any any eq 80 time-range BusinessHours
```

> ✅ Example: Allow HTTP only during business hours.

---

## ✅ 5. Troubleshooting Common ACL Issues

### 5.1 📑 Rule Order Matters

ACLs are **top-down**. The **first match wins**—even if more specific rules follow.

> ✅ Tip: Place **specific permits** above **broad denies**.

---

### 5.2 ❌ Implicit Deny at the End

All ASA ACLs have an **invisible implicit `deny all`** at the end.

> ✅ Solution: Explicitly allow desired traffic before the implicit deny is triggered.

---

### 5.3 🔍 Useful Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
show access-list
show run access-group
debug access-list
```

> ✅ Helps you identify which rules are hit and where traffic is blocked.

---

## 🚀 6. Final Thoughts

Cisco ASA ACLs are a **powerful tool** for enforcing network security and traffic flow. Whether using standard, extended, or object-based ACLs, proper planning and structure allow:
- **Fine-grained traffic control**
- **Improved visibility with logging**

## 🔐 21.5. NAT Services on an ASA

### 🔎 Overview

**Network Address Translation (NAT)** is a foundational feature of Cisco ASA that allows private IP addresses to **communicate with public networks** such as the internet. NAT translates IP addresses as packets traverse the firewall, enabling security and flexibility in routing.

The ASA firewall supports several NAT types, including:
- **Static NAT**
- **Dynamic NAT**
- **Port Address Translation (PAT)**
- **Identity NAT (NAT Exemption)**

Each type serves a specific purpose depending on your **network design, public IP availability**, and **traffic flow needs**.

---

## 🌟 1. Types of NAT in ASA

---

### 1.1 🔁 Static NAT (1:1 Mapping)

Provides a **fixed one-to-one mapping** between internal and public IP addresses. Ideal for services that must be accessible from the internet.

**Example: Static NAT Configuration**
```bash
object network obj_webserver
 host 192.168.1.10
 nat (inside,outside) static 203.0.113.100
```

- Internal host (192.168.1.10) always appears externally as 203.0.113.100.
- Useful for **web servers, mail servers, VPN concentrators**.

---

### 1.2 🔄 Dynamic NAT (Many-to-Many Mapping)

Maps internal addresses **dynamically** to a **pool of public IPs**.

**Example: Dynamic NAT Configuration**
```bash
object network obj_any
 subnet 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0

object network obj_pool
 range 203.0.113.101 203.0.113.110

nat (inside,outside) dynamic obj_pool
```

- Internal hosts are **dynamically assigned** a public IP from the pool.
- One-to-one mapping exists temporarily **per session**.

---

### 1.3 🔁 PAT (Port Address Translation)

Also known as **NAT overload**, PAT allows **many internal devices** to share a **single public IP address**, distinguishing sessions using **unique port numbers**.

**Example: PAT Configuration**
```bash
object network obj_any
 subnet 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0

nat (inside,outside) dynamic interface
```

- **Most common NAT configuration for internet access.**
- Efficient when public IPs are limited.

---

### 1.4 ⛔ Identity NAT (NAT Exemption)

Prevents translation for specific traffic (e.g., internal-to-internal, VPN exclusions).

**Example: Identity NAT Configuration**
```bash
object network obj_local
 subnet 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0

nat (inside,inside) source static obj_local obj_local
```

- Used to **preserve original IPs** between internal zones or for **VPN traffic**.

---

## ✅ 2. Configuring NAT on ASA

---

### 2.1 🛠 Static NAT for a Server

Used when a server needs a **consistent public identity**.

```bash
object network obj_webserver
 host 192.168.1.10
 nat (inside,outside) static 203.0.113.100
```

> ✅ External users connect to the **public IP**, and ASA translates it to the **internal server**.

---

### 2.2 🌐 Dynamic NAT with IP Pool

Multiple hosts share a pool of public IPs.

```bash
object network obj_pool
 range 203.0.113.101 203.0.113.110

object network obj_any
 subnet 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0

nat (inside,outside) dynamic obj_pool
```

> ✅ Good for **larger organizations** with **multiple public IPs**.

---

### 2.3 🔁 PAT (Dynamic NAT Overload)

Allows many internal users to access the internet using **one external IP**.

```bash
object network obj_any
 subnet 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0

nat (inside,outside) dynamic interface
```

> ✅ **Most efficient** NAT method for internet access.

---

### 2.4 🚫 Identity NAT (Exclusion)

Keeps internal IPs intact for **VPN access** or **same-zone routing**.

```bash
object network obj_local
 subnet 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0

nat (inside,inside) source static obj_local obj_local
```

> ✅ Common in **remote access or site-to-site VPNs**.

---

## ✅ 3. Verifying NAT Configuration

After configuration, use ASA commands to ensure translation is working correctly.

---

### 3.1 🔍 View Current Translations
```bash
show xlate
```

- Shows **active NAT translations** in real time.

- A **hands-on lab** to practice NAT types?
- Guidance on **advanced NAT scenarios** (e.g., twice NAT, policy NAT)?Here's a polished and expanded version of **🔐 21.6. AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting)** suitable for instructional use or professional reference:

---

## 🔐 21.6. AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting)

### 🔎 Overview

**AAA**—Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting—is a critical security framework used in Cisco ASA firewalls to manage and control user access. By implementing AAA, you ensure that:
- Only **verified users** can access the device,
- Their access is **restricted to approved resources**,
- Their activities are **logged and auditable**.

Whether managing local users or integrating with **centralized identity servers** (e.g., **TACACS+** or **RADIUS**), AAA enables **fine-grained control and visibility** into administrative access and network security operations.

---

## 🌟 1. What is AAA in ASA?

AAA serves the following functions:

| Component      | Function                                                             |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Authentication** | Verifies who the user is (via username/password, tokens, etc.).        |
| **Authorization**  | Determines what the user can do (e.g., access levels, commands).       |
| **Accounting**     | Tracks what the user did (e.g., login/logout, commands used, durations).|

ASA supports:
- **Local AAA**: Using the internal user database.
- **Remote AAA**: Using TACACS+ or RADIUS servers.

---

## ✅ 2. Configuring AAA on ASA

---

### 2.1 🔐 Local Authentication (Basic Setup)

Best for **small networks or test labs**.

```bash
username admin password YourPassword privilege 15
aaa authentication ssh console LOCAL
```

- `username admin`: Creates a user with **full access** (`privilege 15`).
- `aaa authentication ssh console LOCAL`: Enables **SSH login** using the **local database**.

> ✅ Tip: Always include a fallback local user when using remote AAA for redundancy.

---

### 2.2 🔗 Using a TACACS+ Server

Provides centralized **authentication**, **authorization**, and **accounting**.

```bash
aaa-server TACACS+ protocol tacacs+
aaa-server TACACS+ (inside) host 192.168.1.100 key MySecretKey

aaa authentication ssh console TACACS+ LOCAL
aaa authorization exec default TACACS+ LOCAL
aaa accounting exec default start-stop group TACACS+
```

- **Fallback to LOCAL**: Ensures access if the TACACS+ server is unreachable.
- Common in **enterprise deployments** needing **granular command control**.

---

### 2.3 🔗 Using a RADIUS Server

Simpler than TACACS+, commonly used for **authentication**.

```bash
aaa-server RADIUS protocol radius
aaa-server RADIUS (inside) host 192.168.1.200 key RADIUSKey

aaa authentication ssh console RADIUS LOCAL
aaa authorization exec default RADIUS LOCAL
```

- RADIUS typically combines **authentication** and **authorization** in one step.
- Supports **VPN user management**, **802.1X**, etc.

---

## ✅ 3. Configuring Privilege Levels

Cisco ASA supports **16 privilege levels (0–15)**:
- **Level 15**: Full admin access.
- **Level 0–14**: Limited or custom command access.

```bash
username user1 password User1Password privilege 10
```

> ✅ You can customize which commands are available at each level.

**Privilege Level Examples:**
| Level | Description                    |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| 0     | Very limited (basic commands). |
| 1     | Default user access.           |
| 10    | Mid-level access (custom).     |
| 15    | Full admin access.             |

---

## ✅ 4. Accounting Configuration

Accounting logs **who did what and when**, helping with **auditing**, **compliance**, and **forensics**.

**Example: Configure Exec Session Accounting**
```bash
aaa accounting exec default start-stop group TACACS+
```

- Sends logs to the AAA server when users log in/out of privileged exec mode.

---

### 4.1 🧾 Viewing Accounting Logs

- **Syslog Server**: If configured, accounting messages are sent to external log collectors.
- **AAA Server Console**: TACACS+/RADIUS logs are typically available via GUI or CLI on the server.

---

## ✅ 5. Viewing & Troubleshooting AAA

**Useful Commands:**
```bash
show aaa-server
show running-config aaa
debug aaa authentication
```

These commands help troubleshoot **authentication failures**, **server communication**, and **policy application**.

> ⚠️ Use `debug` with caution in production—it is resource-intensive.

---

## 🚀 6. Final Thoughts

AAA on ASA is essential for:
- Enforcing **who can access** the firewall.
- Controlling **what they can do**.
- Logging **all activity** for compliance and visibility.

By combining local configuration for backup and remote integration for scale, AAA enables **secure, auditable, and manageable** firewall access control.

- **ASDM instructions** for configuring AAA graphically?
- A **custom command privilege policy example**?Here’s a refined and structured version of **🔐 21.7. Service Policies on an ASA**, perfect for study, documentation, or practical configuration guidance:

---

## 🔐 21.7. Service Policies on an ASA

### 🔎 Overview

**Service Policies** on a Cisco ASA allow administrators to **define how traffic is managed, inspected, and prioritized** as it flows through the firewall. These policies extend beyond basic access control to include:
- **Protocol inspection** for application-layer protection
- **Quality of Service (QoS)** and **traffic shaping**
- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)** for security enforcement

Service policies are configured using **class maps** and **policy maps**, then applied globally or per interface using a **service-policy** command.

---

## 🌟 1. What are Service Policies?

Service Policies determine **how the ASA processes network traffic** by:
- Applying protocol inspection (e.g., HTTP, SMTP, FTP)
- Enabling DPI for advanced security
- Prioritizing traffic (e.g., VoIP over bulk downloads)
- Limiting bandwidth for non-critical applications

They provide **granular control** over both security and performance, and are typically used in conjunction with ACLs and NAT rules.

---

## ✅ 2. Types of Service Policies

---

### 2.1 🔒 Access Control Extension

While **ACLs** control basic traffic flow (permit/deny), service policies enhance this by **inspecting** and **managing behavior** of allowed traffic, particularly at **application and protocol levels**.

---

### 2.2 ⚙️ Traffic Shaping & QoS

Used to **limit bandwidth** or **prioritize specific traffic types** like voice, video, or business-critical apps.

**Example: Basic Traffic Policing**
```bash
policy-map global_policy
 class class-default
  police input 1000000 500000 20000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop
service-policy global_policy global
```

- Limits traffic to 1 Mbps, with burst handling.
- Ensures **traffic smoothing** and **congestion protection**.

---

### 2.3 🔍 Protocol Inspection

ASA can inspect various protocols for **anomalies or threats**.

**Example: Enabling HTTP Inspection**
```bash
policy-map global_policy
 class inspection_default
  inspect http
service-policy global_policy global
```

- Ensures ASA monitors **HTTP traffic** for known attacks (e.g., XSS, injections).

---

### 2.4 🧠 Application Layer Inspection (DPI)

Performs **deep packet inspection** of protocols like:
- **SMTP** – Email attacks (spam, malware)
- **DNS** – Botnet command-and-control detection
- **FTP** – Credential leakage

**Example: SMTP Inspection**
```bash
policy-map global_policy
 class inspection_default
  inspect smtp
```

---

## ✅ 3. Configuring Service Policies

---

### 3.1 🛠 Step-by-Step: Basic Policy Map

#### Step 1: Define a Class Map
```bash
class-map inspection_default
 match default-inspection-traffic
```

#### Step 2: Create a Policy Map
```bash
policy-map global_policy
 class inspection_default
  inspect http
  inspect smtp
  inspect dns
```

#### Step 3: Apply the Service Policy Globally
```bash
service-policy global_policy global
```

---

### 3.2 🎯 Prioritize Critical Services (e.g., VoIP)

#### Step 1: Classify VoIP Traffic
```bash
class-map match-any VoIP
 match protocol sip
 match protocol rtp
```

#### Step 2: Prioritize VoIP in Policy Map
```bash
policy-map global_policy
 class VoIP
  priority 512
```

#### Step 3: Apply Service Policy
```bash
service-policy global_policy global
```

> 🛡️ This ensures **SIP/RTP gets minimum 512 Kbps** and low latency.

---

### 3.3 📊 Monitoring & Verification

Use the following command to verify traffic matches and inspect statistics:
```bash
show service-policy
```

You’ll see:
