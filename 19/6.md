# 🔐 19.6. Site-to-Site IPsec VPNs – Summary

A **Site-to-Site IPsec VPN** connects two or more entire networks over an untrusted network like the internet using **Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)**. Unlike Remote Access VPNs, which connect individual users, Site-to-Site VPNs link **VPN gateways** (e.g., routers, firewalls) to allow secure communication between **branch offices**, **remote data centers**, or **partner networks**.

By **authenticating endpoints**, **encrypting traffic**, and ensuring **data integrity**, Site-to-Site VPNs create a secure communication tunnel that mimics a private, dedicated line—**but over a public network**.

## 🧱 Key Components of Site-to-Site IPsec VPNs

| **Component**             | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **VPN Gateways**          | Routers or firewalls that establish and maintain the VPN tunnel                 |
| **Encryption & Authentication** | Use of **AES (e.g., AES-256)** for confidentiality and **SHA-256** for data integrity |
| **Security Associations (SAs)** | Define which algorithms and keys are used to secure traffic between endpoints |
| **IKE (Internet Key Exchange)** | Negotiates keys and security policies between devices (Phase 1 and 2)       |
| **Tunnel Mode**           | Encrypts the entire IP packet (header and payload) – used in Site-to-Site VPNs |

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step: Implementing a Site-to-Site IPsec VPN

### 🔹 **Phase 1: IKE Authentication and Key Exchange**
- Devices authenticate using:
  - **Pre-shared keys** (simpler, less scalable)
  - **Digital certificates** (preferred in larger environments)
- Negotiate:
  - Encryption algorithms (e.g., **AES-256**)
  - Integrity checks (e.g., **SHA-256**)
  - Key exchange mechanism (e.g., **Diffie-Hellman**)
- Establish a secure IKE SA (Security Association) to protect Phase 2 negotiations

### 🔹 **Phase 2: IPsec Tunnel Establishment**
- Negotiate **IPsec SAs** for actual data encryption
- Use **ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)** to:
  - Encrypt the data
  - Ensure its integrity and authenticity
- Begin **secure transmission** through the tunnel

### 🔹 **Routing Configuration**
- Ensure traffic between sites is routed through the tunnel
- Options:
  - **Static routing** – Simpler but harder to scale
  - **Dynamic routing** (e.g., **OSPF**) – Scales well and adapts to topology changes
- Define routing policies to match encrypted traffic destinations

### 🔹 **Crypto Map Configuration**
- A crypto map includes:
  - **Peer IP address**
  - **Transform set** (encryption/authentication algorithms)
  - **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to match which traffic should be encrypted
- Multiple crypto maps can be defined for different peers

### 🔹 **Apply Crypto Map to Interface**
- Bind the crypto map to the outbound-facing interface (usually the WAN link)
- This ensures that matched traffic is processed by the IPsec engine

## 🧩 Key Considerations

### 🔐 Security
- Always use **strong cryptographic standards** (e.g., AES-256, SHA-256)
- Enable **anti-replay protection** and **PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy)** for better resilience

### 🔐 Authentication
- Use **digital certificates** issued by a **trusted CA** for enterprise-grade security
- Pre-shared keys are fine for small-scale or temporary setups

### 📡 Routing
- Ensure that **routing tables** are updated and that VPN traffic doesn’t accidentally leak through the internet
- Consider **split tunneling** or **full tunneling** based on use case

### 🔑 Key Lifetime Management
- Configure **IPsec and IKE lifetimes** to periodically renegotiate keys (e.g., 1 hour for Phase 2)
- Prevents long-lived keys from becoming vulnerable to brute-force or replay attacks

## 🧪 Testing and Verification

| **Task**                 | **How to Verify**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **VPN Tunnel Status**    | Use commands like `show crypto isakmp sa` or `show vpn-sessiondb` (platform-dependent) |
| **Connectivity Tests**   | Ping remote internal IP addresses, test services (e.g., SMB, RDP, HTTP)           |
| **Log Monitoring**       | Check VPN logs for IKE failures, SA mismatches, or dropped packets                |
| **Debugging Tools**      | Enable `debug crypto isakmp`, `debug crypto ipsec`, and review real-time tunnel activity |

## ✅ Benefits of Site-to-Site IPsec VPNs

### 🔒 Security
- All traffic is **encrypted end-to-end**, preventing data leakage
- Authentication ensures that only **trusted peers** can communicate

### 💪 Reliability
- Once established, IPsec tunnels provide **consistent** and **resilient** connectivity

### 💰 Cost-Effectiveness
- No need for dedicated leased lines—**secure public internet** becomes the transport layer

### 📈 Scalability
- Easily expand by **adding more VPN gateways** or automating deployment via templates and centralized controllers
