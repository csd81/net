## üîê 19.4. Crypto Map

### üîé Overview  
A **Crypto Map** is a crucial configuration element in setting up **IPsec VPN tunnels** on routers and firewalls. It acts as a blueprint that brings together all required components for VPN communication, such as peer IP, encryption/authentication methods, traffic selectors (ACLs), and Security Association (SA) lifetimes.

By applying a crypto map to an interface, the device knows:
- Which traffic to protect.
- How to protect it.
- With whom to establish a secure tunnel.

It enables **site-to-site** or **remote-access VPNs** by defining how IPsec should handle the traffic.

---

## üåü 1. What is a Crypto Map?

A **Crypto Map** is a set of policies and rules that:
- Defines the **remote peer** (VPN gateway).
- Specifies the **transform set** (encryption/integrity settings).
- Uses an **ACL** to determine which traffic should be encrypted.
- Binds the configuration to a specific **interface** on the device.

Crypto maps must be applied to the physical or logical interface that sends and receives protected traffic, usually an external-facing interface.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Components of a Crypto Map

Each crypto map entry typically includes the following elements:

### 1. üîê **IPsec Transform Set**
Defines the algorithms used for:
- **Encryption** (e.g., AES-256)
- **Integrity/Authentication** (e.g., SHA-256 using HMAC)

> Example: `crypto ipsec transform-set MYTRANSFORMSET esp-aes-256 esp-sha-hmac`

---

### 2. üåê **Peer IP Address**
Specifies the IP address of the **remote VPN gateway**. This tells the router who to negotiate the tunnel with.

> Example: `set peer 192.168.2.1`

---

### 3. üìã **Access Control List (ACL)**
Defines which traffic (based on source/destination IP) should be protected by IPsec.

> Example:
```bash
access-list 100 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255
```
This matches traffic between two internal subnets to be secured.

---

### 4. ‚è± **Security Association (SA) Lifetime**
Defines how long the IPsec SA is valid before renegotiation. This ensures periodic key changes for enhanced security.

> Example: Can be set using `set security-association lifetime seconds 3600`

---

### 5. üåê **NAT-T (NAT Traversal)** (Optional)  
If one or both VPN devices are behind a NAT, **NAT Traversal (NAT-T)** allows IPsec to work by encapsulating ESP in UDP packets (usually port 4500).

> Enabled automatically if NAT is detected, or manually with:
```bash
crypto isakmp nat-traversal 20
```

---

### 6. üî¢ **Crypto Map Priority**
The sequence number in a crypto map determines its **priority**. The lowest number has the highest priority and is matched first.

> Example:  
`crypto map MYCRYPTO_MAP 10 ipsec-isakmp`  
‚Üí `10` is the priority.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Configuring a Crypto Map

### üß± Step-by-Step Example (Cisco IOS):

#### üîπ Step 1: Define the IPsec Transform Set
```bash
crypto ipsec transform-set MYTRANSFORMSET esp-aes-256 esp-sha-hmac
```
- `esp-aes-256`: Encrypts using AES-256
- `esp-sha-hmac`: Authenticates using SHA-256 (HMAC)

---

#### üîπ Step 2: Define the Crypto Map
```bash
crypto map MYCRYPTO_MAP 10 ipsec-isakmp
 set peer 192.168.2.1
 set transform-set MYTRANSFORMSET
 match address VPN_ACL
```

Explanation:
- **`MYCRYPTO_MAP`**: Name of the crypto map
- **`10`**: Sequence/priority
- **`ipsec-isakmp`**: Specifies IKE (Phase 1) + IPsec (Phase 2)
- **`set peer`**: Defines the remote VPN peer
- **`match address`**: Links to ACL that defines protected traffic

---

#### üîπ Step 3: Define the ACL
```bash
access-list 100 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255
```
- Matches traffic from local to remote network that should be encrypted.

---

#### üîπ Step 4: Apply Crypto Map to Interface
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 crypto map MYCRYPTO_MAP
```
- Applies the crypto map to the interface used to reach the remote peer.

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Verification and Monitoring

To ensure the VPN is active and secure:

### üîç 1. Check Crypto Map Configuration
```bash
show crypto map
```

### üîç 2. View IPsec Security Associations
```bash
show crypto ipsec sa
```
- Displays tunnel status, packets encrypted/decrypted, and lifetime info.

### üîç 3. Verify ISAKMP (IKE Phase 1) Status
```bash
show crypto ikev2 sa
```
- Confirms successful Phase 1 negotiation and peer identity.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Troubleshooting Crypto Map Issues

If the VPN tunnel isn't working:

### üõ† Common Checks:
- **Encryption/Auth Mismatch**: Both peers must use matching transform sets.
- **ACL Errors**: Ensure the ACL matches **bidirectional** traffic between networks.
- **NAT-T**: Required if either side is behind NAT. Ensure it‚Äôs enabled if needed.
- **SA Lifetime**: Mismatched SA lifetimes can prevent tunnel establishment.
- **Use Debugs for Insight**:
  - `debug crypto isakmp`
  - `debug crypto ipsec`

---

## üöÄ 6. Final Thoughts

The **Crypto Map** is the core mechanism by which a router or firewall understands how to secure traffic using IPsec. It ties together:
- **Who** to communicate with (peer)
- **How** to protect the traffic (transform set)
- **What** traffic to protect (ACL)
- **Where** to apply protection (interface)

Proper configuration and monitoring of crypto maps is essential for establishing and maintaining secure, stable IPsec VPN connections between sites or remote users.
